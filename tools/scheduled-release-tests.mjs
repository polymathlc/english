// Regression tests for ⏳ SCHEDULED RELEASE — a question that is IN the bank
// and not yet due.  Run with:  node tools/scheduled-release-tests.mjs
//
// ⚡ Rapid add can file a whole batch with a release date on it: the questions
// go into Vetting as they always did, are approved into the bank as they always
// were, and are simply not SERVED to anybody until that morning. Every way that
// goes wrong is silent, and each one lands on a class:
//
//  • A POOL THAT FORGETS THE GATE serves a question weeks early, on a screen
//    that looks perfectly right, with nothing anywhere to say it happened. That
//    is what the CENSUS at the bottom of this file exists for — it fails on the
//    NEXT pool somebody adds without the gate, not on the last one.
//  • A GATE THAT IS TOO EAGER is worse in the other direction: a value that is
//    not a day key, or a date that has already come round, must leave the
//    question behaving exactly as an unscheduled one. A question withheld from
//    every mode for ever by a field nobody can read is the silent disappearance
//    this app spends most of its guards preventing.
//  • THE DAY IS SINGAPORE'S. Read it off the device and a paper is out a day
//    early on half the class's phones and a day late on the rest.
//  • A BATCH READ LATE is a batch filed wrong. A forty-page paper takes minutes
//    to render with the pad open the whole time, so the date has to be captured
//    when the file is QUEUED — the same rule the batch level already follows.
//  • A SCHEDULE NOBODY CAN SEE is a schedule nobody can undo. The badge has to
//    be on every management surface, and the date has to survive an edit.
