# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude when working in this repo.

## The app

`index.html` + `app.js` — the **"English Learning Portal"** (the product name in
the sidebar, the `<title>` and the footer). Admin question authoring (block
editor, AI build-from-screenshot, image crop/touch-up, vetting → bank) plus
student practice, worksheets and marking.

**The markup and CSS live in `index.html`; ALL of the application JavaScript
lives in `app.js`**, loaded as `<script type="module" src="app.js">`. They ship
together — `index.html` is useless without `app.js` next to it, so deploy the
directory, never the single file.

This is a fork of the Science portal (`polymathlc/cer`) with the entire game
layer removed. See **The fork** at the bottom for what that means in practice.

- Functions referenced from inline `onclick`/`on*` handlers MUST be assigned to
  `window` near the bottom of `app.js` (search `window.navigateTo =`), because
  the module has its own scope.
- `const` declared mid-module is in its temporal dead zone earlier in the file —
  only read such values at call time, not at module-eval time.

## Where the data lives — read this before touching any Firestore path

This app shares a Firebase PROJECT with the Science portal and shares **no data**
with it. Every collection is named once, at the top of `app.js`, and every path
is built from those constants (`QUESTIONS_COL`, `SETTINGS_COL`, `PROFILES_COL`,
`PROGRESS_COL`, …). Nothing else in the file spells a collection name out — keep
it that way.

**That rule is not style, and v1.3.0 is what it costs to break it.** Four
functions are the only door to the bank — `_qRef` / `_vRef` / `_qCol` / `_vCol`
— and they spelled `'questions'` and `'vetting'` inline: the Science app's own
names, under the same `users/{uid}` tree, in the same project. So for three
versions the two apps were *one bank wearing two front ends*. Every English
question this app saved landed in the Science bank and every Science question
came back out of it. Nothing threw. Nothing looked broken. The only symptom was
Science questions listed on the English bank page, which reads as a filter bug.
Three things follow:

- **A shared-name path fails LOUDLY nowhere and quietly everywhere.** The
  fail-closed warning below is about names the rules *don't* know; this is the
  opposite and worse — a name the rules know for the *other app*, which works
  perfectly and silently merges two data sets.
- **`mistakes`, `flashcards` and `scheduledQuestions` had the same bug** and
  are now `mistakesEn` / `flashcardsEn` / `scheduledQuestionsEn`. The comment
  above them used to say they were "shared with no one"; they were shared with
  the Science app, which writes exactly those three names under the same user.
  `scheduledQuestions` was the dangerous one: a question the SCIENCE app had
  queued would have been released into the ENGLISH bank on its release date,
  re-linking the two a day after they were separated.
- **The one-time rescue is `_lb*`** (📦 From Science bank, on the Question Bank
  page, admin only). It moves what was written to the wrong collection back
  across, deciding subject by TOPIC — the two topic lists share no entry and a
  topic comes off a `<select>`, so it is a strong signal, and anything neither
  list knows is listed UNTICKED for the admin to decide rather than guessed at.
  It copies, **reads the copy back**, and only then deletes the original; a copy
  that cannot be verified leaves the original where it is. Delete the tool once
  the banks have been apart long enough that nobody is upgrading across it.

**A name the Firestore rules do not know about fails closed**: reads come back
empty, writes are denied, and nothing on screen explains why. So a new
collection means a matching block in `firestore.rules`, deployed alongside the
Science app's rules — never replacing them. `README.md` has the deploy steps.

The bank starts EMPTY, deliberately: `users/{uid}/questionsEn` does not exist
until the first English question is written.

## The subject switcher — four apps, one student (v1.15.0)

`SUBJECT_APPS` / `subject*` (in `app.js`, search `THE SUBJECT SWITCHER`), plus
`#subjectSwitch` and the `.subject-*` CSS in `index.html`. A pill in the
**top-right of every page** naming the subject you are in; click it and the
other three are one tap away.

Polymath teaches four subjects through four separate apps, and they share a
Firebase project and a sign-in and **nothing else** — four banks, four sets of
progress, four topic lists. A student taught three of them had one bookmark per
subject on a school Chromebook, and the subject they never bookmarked is the
one they stopped using.

- **It is a LINK, not a router.** Four `<a href>`s and no JS navigation: each
  app stays reachable at its own URL exactly as before, nothing here redirects
  or gates anything, and middle-click / open-in-new-tab behave the way a
  student expects — which a `location.href =` handler would quietly break.
- **The URLs are RELATIVE (`../cer/`), and that is load-bearing.** The four are
  GitHub Pages project sites — `polymathlc.github.io/{math,english,chinese,cer}`
  — so they are sibling folders on one host, and a relative hop resolves there,
  on a local checkout with the four repos side by side, and on a custom domain
  later, without this file ever naming a host. An absolute
  `https://polymathlc.github.io/…` works perfectly until the centre moves to a
  domain of its own and then sends every student back to the old one.
- **Science lives at `../cer/`** — the repo name, not the subject name. The
  label and the folder differ on purpose; `../science/` is a 404 for the whole
  school at once and reads as a link somebody forgot to finish.
- **`SUBJECT_KEY` says which of the four THIS app is**, and it is the ONE line
  that differs between the repos — everything else in the block is identical in
  all four, so a fix copies straight across. `subjectCurrent()` falls back to
  the first entry, so a `SUBJECT_KEY` naming nothing does not throw: it labels
  this app "Math" and offers a link back to the app you are already in.
- **The menu is built from `SUBJECT_APPS`**, never written out in `index.html`,
  so a subject added to that list appears by editing one line per app.
- **The current subject is shown and marked, never dropped.** A menu that
  silently omits where you already are leaves a student unable to tell which
  app they are looking at. It is a `<div>` rather than an `<a>` — a link back to
  the page you are on reloads the app and loses whatever was half-typed.
- **It is turned on from `configureSidebarForRole`**, the one function every
  signed-in path (admin, employee, student) already goes through, rather than
  from three call sites that could drift. It is hidden until then, or it floats
  over the login card belonging to nobody.
- **`z-index: 150` sits in a deliberate gap**: above the sidebar (100) and every
  sticky `.page-header` (50) so it is always reachable, and below every modal
  (`.confirm-overlay` and friends start at 200) so a dialog covers it rather
  than being covered by it.
- **`.page-header` gives up its right-hand corner** (`padding-right`), because
  that is where every page keeps its action buttons and the switcher floats
  over them. It is fixed to the viewport rather than dropped into a header
  because this app has no global top bar at all — forty-odd pages carry their
  own `.page-header`, and a page added next month would be the one that quietly
  had no switcher on it.
- The CSS is written against the design tokens and nothing else, so the **same
  block is used in all four apps** and each paints it in its own palette. A
  themed copy per app is a copy that drifts.
- Run **`node tools/subject-level-tests.mjs`** after touching any of it.

## Keep the page fast — these are load-bearing, do not undo them

- Fonts are ONE non-blocking request (`media="print" onload="this.media='all'"`).
  Adding another render-blocking `<link rel="stylesheet">` to Google Fonts puts
  first paint back at the mercy of the school's network. Crimson Pro is
  deliberately `media="print"` — it is only used by the printed worksheet cover.
- There is NO icon font. The landing-page icons are inline SVG inside
  `.material-symbols-outlined` spans. Do not reintroduce Material Symbols: the
  variable webfont is 1.1 MB.
- Tailwind is PREBUILT and inlined (search `Tailwind, prebuilt`). Do not put the
  `cdn.tailwindcss.com` Play CDN back — it ships a CSS compiler to the student's
  phone. Regenerate via `docs/tailwind/` instead.
- `<link rel="modulepreload" href="app.js">` in the head is what starts the app
  download early. Keep it, and keep it pointing at the right filename.

## Learner progress

`progress` (in `app.js`, search `LEARNER PROGRESS`) is the plain record of work
done: questions marked, how many were right, the fractional marks total and the
day streak. My Report, the student Home screen, the teacher's Usage dashboard
and Ai-nstein all read it. It replaced the RPG hero doc the Science app used.

- **`progressOnMarked(q, score, total, opts)` is the ONE hook** every marking
  path calls, through `recordCerPerformance`. Do not add a second.
- Stored at `users/{uid}/{SETTINGS_COL}/progress`, mirrored to `PROGRESS_COL`
  so a teacher — who cannot read another account's settings tree — can see the
  class. That mirror carries **counts only**: never answers, never the mark on a
  particular question.
- **`correct` is a valid lower bound on `creditSum`.** Every question in the
  binary count scored ≥ 0.95, so an honestly accumulated `creditSum` can never
  sit below `0.95 × correct`; `progressHydrate` seeds it from the binary count
  when it is lower, and `progressPublish` takes the higher of the two. Without
  that, a counter added later reads every earlier question as WRONG for the rest
  of the account's life. Any future counter added beside an older one needs the
  same treatment.
- Writes coalesce (600 ms) and the class mirror publishes at 1500 ms — a photo
  answer marks every part at once and would otherwise be one write per part.

## Learning gaps and the daily retry credits

`lgState` (in `app.js`, search `LEARNING GAPS`) is the list of what one student
does not understand yet — **named** weaknesses ("past perfect tense", "the word
'reluctant'"), not topics. The mistake log records what went wrong on a
particular question; this is the same evidence read as a list that outlives the
question. Stored at `users/{uid}/{SETTINGS_COL}/{GAPS_DOC}`, and **not mirrored
to the class collection**: a list of what a child cannot do is not a class
statistic.

- **`lgNoteFromParts` is the ONE hook**, and it is called from inside
  `fcNoteMistakes` — the function every marking path already funnels its wrong
  answers through. Do not add a second; a surface added later is covered free.
- The list does three jobs and it is the **same list** for all three: it is shown
  to the student, it **picks** the bank questions they are served
  (`lgBankQuestionsFor`), and it **briefs the AI** when the bank has nothing left
  (`lgBuildQuestion`, which goes through `buildBlocksFromAi` like every other AI
  authoring path). A generated question is **never saved** — the bank is the
  teacher's, and nothing unvetted belongs in it.
- **The AI names the gap; the question's own tags are the fallback.** With the AI
  off or the call failed, `_lgFallbackItems` files the mistake under the
  question's tags or topic. The list must never simply stop filling. But an
  **empty `items` array is a real answer** — the model is told to return one when
  a slip shows no misunderstanding — so it is not overridden by the fallback.
- **A gap is closed by the student, not the clock**: `LG_CLEAR_WINS` right in a
  row (`lgNoteWin`, called from `recordCerPerformance` at the same ≥0.95
  threshold `progressOnMarked` uses). One wrong answer **re-opens** it.
- **Credits are `REGEN_DAILY_CREDITS` (30) a day, reset by calendar day**, spent
  BEFORE the AI call so two quick taps cannot buy two questions for one credit,
  and **refunded when the call fails**. `_lgRollCredits` must run on load or a
  stale `dayKey` hands out one allowance and never another.
- `_lgHostId` is the ONE place a gap key becomes an element id, and it is
  injective on purpose — a bare strip of non-alphanumerics lets two gaps share a
  host, and the second one's button then does nothing at all.
- Run **`node tools/learning-gap-tests.mjs`** after touching any of it: a
  mis-keyed gap, a credit that misses the rollover and a gap that cannot re-open
  are all silent.

Topic lists carry **no P3–P6 headings** — not the bank filter, the authoring
`<select>`, the manage dialog or the student topic grid. An English topic is not
owned by a year the way a Science one is. The level each topic is filed under is
still live (it gates what a student may be served); it is simply not announced.

## The two comprehension formats — one passage, many questions

Both arrived in v1.6.0 and both exist because the block editor could not express
a **passage with its own sub-questions as ONE bank question**.

### Sub-questions are LETTERED — (a) (b) (c) — whatever the paper called them

**Every automatic path letters them** (v1.8.0): the passage builder, and the AI
read of a screenshot set. The paper's 16, 17, 18 / 21, 22, 23 are *that exam
paper's* numbering, not this question's — a bank question stands on its own, and
one that opens at part (21) reads as though twenty parts are missing.

- **The markers INSIDE the passage are renumbered to match**
  (`_pbRelabelPassage`). The paper prints "(16)" against the underlined word
  question 16 asks about; letter the questions and leave the passage alone and
  the student reads "(16)" over the word, then hunts for a question 16 that is
  now part (a). Only the **parenthesised whole number** is rewritten, so "(160)"
  and the 16 in "16 January" survive. The AI prompt asks for the same rewrite on
  any passage text it transcribes.
- **Past the alphabet a sub-question is DROPPED and the author is told**
  (`pbPartOverflow`). It is never given an empty part: `qPartMap` inherits
  forward, so an unlabelled sub-question is filed under the previous one and two
  option lists share a heading.
- `pbPartLetter(i)` is the one place an index becomes a letter.

### Parts may still be NUMBERS

`qPartNormalize` accepts **1–999** as well as a letter. Nothing automatic
produces one any more — the parts bar's **Number from** box is the deliberate
manual escape hatch, for an author who does want the paper's numbering.

- **Detection is deliberately NOT extended.** `qPartDetect` still matches
  letters only — a number at the start of a line is a question number, a
  quantity or a year far more often than it is a part. Assigning is a decision;
  detecting is a guess, which is why `QPART_ASSIGN` was already longer than
  `QPART_LETTERS`.
- The letter branch now requires **length 1**: `indexOf` on a *string* matches
  substrings, so `'ab'` used to come back as a valid part — one no picker could
  show and no key could label.
- `autoNumberParts(startAt)` takes an optional start; the parts bar's **Number
  from** box feeds it, and blank falls back to the letters.
- **`QPART_OPENER_TYPES` is `['text', 'mcq']`.** An MCQ joins because these
  papers have no text block to hang the part on — the sub-question is nothing
  but its four options. Both print paths and `buildOpenBody` print the label for
  an MCQ that opens a part, which is what makes that safe (the original
  text-only rule existed so a part could never be labelled on the key with
  nothing marking it on the paper).

### 📑 The passage builder (`pb*`)

Paste the passage and the option lists as they are on the paper; out comes one
text block plus one MCQ per sub-question, each opening its own lettered part.

- **The parse is deterministic — there is no AI in it.** A wrong guess here is
  not a wrong answer, it is four options quietly filed under the wrong number.
- A question opens on a **bare** number at the start of a line; an option number
  is **parenthesised and single-digit**. That one rule is what stops the "(16)"
  markers inside the passage reading as options, and stops "20,000 animals
  across 1,000 species" reading as question 20.
- A line that is neither **continues the option above it** — an option long
  enough to wrap arrives as two lines, and dropping the tail loses half the
  answer with nothing looking wrong.
- **An unticked sub-question is saved with no correct option.** Guessing one
  marks every class that ever sits it against the wrong word.

### Reading a passage set off SCREENSHOTS (v1.7.0)

The multi-screenshot build and the `box_2d` auto-crop both already existed —
`aiBuildFromScreenshot` reads N images as ONE question and
`_autoFillDiagramsFromBoxes` crops each AI-drawn rectangle out of its own page.
The one thing missing was a way for the model to say **"these four options are
question 21 of the passage"**, so a comprehension page came back as eight
option lists in a row with nothing telling them apart.

- **`buildBlocksFromAi` honours an explicit `"part"`** on any AI block, through
  `qPartNormalize` — so `"b"` and `"21"` both work, though the prompt now asks
  for letters — with `QPART_NONE` preserved. It is stamped on the FIRST block that entry produced, because
  `qPartMap` inherits forward. This is the ONE function every AI authoring path
  goes through, so all of them gained it at once.
- **`qLiftPartMarkers` already skipped a block that opens a part**, which is
  what stops the typed-marker pass overwriting the model's numbering.
- **The rules live in `_partsPromptRules()`**, the fragment all four build
  prompts carry — do not restate them in a prompt. They tell the model to
  LETTER the sub-questions in order and to rewrite any "(16)" marker in the
  passage text to the matching letter.
- **`qPartLabelFirst(blocks, block)` decides who prints the label.** A numbered
  question is usually a text block (the wording) and an MCQ (the options) both
  filed under (21); labelled twice the paper reads "(21) What does… (21) (1)
  humans", which looks like a printing fault. `buildOpenBody` and both print
  builders ask the same function, so screen and paper cannot disagree.
- **The token budget scales with the pages** (`4096 + 3000 × extra`, capped at
  16384). Running out does not fail — it TRUNCATES, and `_repairAIJson` then
  hands back a valid-looking question missing its last few sub-questions.
  `_aiJsonRepaired` is set when a reply had to be repaired, and the build warns
  the author instead of letting the tail go quietly.
- **A sub-question the model could not answer is built with NO tick.** It works
  the answers out from the passage rather than reading a marking scheme, so the
  completion toast says how many need checking. Never turn a missing
  `correctIndex` into a guess.
- Run **`node tools/ai-parts-tests.mjs`** after touching any of it.

### 🔤 The comprehension cloze (`cb*`, block type `clozebank`)

One passage, numbered blanks, and a bank of words lettered (A)–(Q) above it.
The student drags a word into a blank and it is struck off.

- It is **`fillblank`'s sibling, not a variant**. A fill-in-the-blank is marked
  on what the student *wrote*, so it goes to the AI for synonyms and spelling.
  Here the student picks from a closed list, so the mark is exact, instant and
  free — an AI pass could only turn a right answer wrong.
- **The answers ARE the bank**: `cbBank` derives the list from the blanks plus
  the author's distractors, so a bank missing one of its own answers cannot be
  authored. It renders perfectly, prints perfectly and is unanswerable.
- `[[word]]` is **the same markup `fillblank` uses**, parsed by the same
  `_fbParse`. `_fbChipsHtml` takes the toggle to call, because hardcoding
  `fbToggleToken` made every cloze chip a no-op that looked like a working one.
- **`CB_LETTERS` skips I and O** — a handwritten (I) is a 1 and a handwritten
  (O) is a 0. The paper says so in as many words, and `cbIntro` generates that
  sentence from the passage so it cannot drift from it.
- **Struck-off is a RENDER of the placements** (`_cbUsed`), never a second list;
  a flag kept beside them is one drag away from disagreeing with the passage.
  The tapped-and-waiting word lives on the element, not in a map keyed by block
  id — the same block can be on screen in two surfaces at once.
- **Every blank is also a DROP-DOWN** (`.cb-pick`, v1.13.0), because on a passage
  of any length the bank has scrolled off the top long before blank (33) — and a
  word you cannot see is a word you cannot drag. **`_cbOptionsHtml` is the ONE
  place a blank's list is worked out**: the letter already in this blank, plus
  every letter not sitting in another one. A blank must always keep its OWN word,
  or the `<select>` falls back to the first option and the student's answer
  changes by itself.
- **The drop-down list and the struck-off bank are BOTH renders of the same
  placements**, rebuilt together by `_cbSyncBank` — which every path that moves a
  word already calls, so nothing needed a second set of call sites. A list kept
  beside them is one change away from offering a word the bank has struck off.
- **A click inside `.cb-pick` is the drop-down's own**: without the guard, the
  slot's "tap a filled blank to take the word back" handler empties the blank the
  moment it is opened, and Enter/Space never reach the `<select>` at all.
- `appearance:auto` on `.cb-pick` is **not optional** — Tailwind's preflight sets
  it to `none`, which takes the arrow off and leaves something that does not read
  as a control (the same trap as a bare checkbox).
- A **used word is still draggable**, and dropping it MOVES it. Refusing the
  drag would make the only way to correct blank 26 a tap to release and a second
  drag to place. The drop-down is the opposite by design — a word in use is not
  offered elsewhere — so a word is released by setting its blank to "—" or by
  tapping the struck-off word in the bank.
- **The bank is read DOWN the columns**, as the paper sets it, and the cells are
  sized from the columns actually filled (`_cbCols`).
- Both print builders carry an **explicit `case 'clozebank'`** for exactly the
  reason `fillblank` does, one step worse: falling through to the student
  rendering prints a draggable word bank over a passage of drop targets.
- Run **`node tools/passage-cloze-tests.mjs`** after touching any of it.

### 📝 The OPEN cloze (`co*`, block type `clozeopen`) — v1.10.0

The same passage with numbered blanks and **nothing to choose from**: the
student types a word into every blank and submits the lot at once. It arrives
from a screenshot — the AI reads the page, transcribes the passage and makes the
blanks itself.

**It exists because of one fact: a cloze blank almost never has a single right
answer.** *"Dishes like chicken rice ______ people from all backgrounds
together"* takes bring, draw, pull, tie. That is what separates all three
members of the family — `clozebank` gives a closed list so the mark is exact,
`fillblank` marks one word against ONE expected answer, and here neither is
true.

- **A blank stores EVERY answer it accepts**, inside the same `[[markup]]`,
  pipe-separated: `[[bring|draw|pull]]`. One field, one parser, and no nested
  array for Firestore to reject. **`coAlts` is the ONE place that string becomes
  a list**; the first entry is the primary and leads the printed key.
- **Anything on that list is marked correct locally** (`coAccepts`) — no AI
  call, no cost, and no chance of a model talking itself out of a word the
  teacher already accepted. Case and stray punctuation are normalised away; the
  apostrophe and hyphen are NOT, because "its"/"it's" are different words.
- **Everything else goes to the AI in ONE call carrying the whole passage**
  (`coMarkPassage`). A cloze word is right or wrong because of the sentence
  around it, so a blank sent alone cannot be marked fairly — that is all
  `fillblank` can do. The prompt says in as many words that **the stored list is
  not exhaustive**; without that the model just re-checks the list and the whole
  feature collapses back into `fillblank`.
- **The whole passage submits at ONE button.** Fifteen blanks behind fifteen
  Check buttons is a different exercise, and it leaks the answers one at a time.
- **Every blank is the SAME width** (`_coSlotWidth`, taken from the longest
  answer in the passage). `fillblank` sizes each box from its own answer; here
  the student has to think of the word, so a box wider than its neighbours is a
  hint the paper never gives.
- **The AI builder must NOT run the passage through `stripBrackets`** — that
  helper exists to pull `[[ ]]` out of a model answer, and on a cloze it erases
  every blank, leaving a paragraph that renders and prints perfectly and asks
  the student nothing.
- `_coText` keeps the passage's paragraphs (a run of blank lines collapses to
  one — at line-height 3.1 two `<br>`s are six lines of nothing).
- The rule the model reads lives in **`_partsPromptRules()`** with the synthesis
  one; ✨ **Suggest alternatives** (`coAiAlternatives`) does the same job for a
  hand-typed passage and **only ever widens** a blank's list, never narrows it.
- Run **`node tools/open-cloze-tests.mjs`** after touching any of it.

### ✏️ The EDITING passage (`ed*`, block type `editpassage`) — v1.11.0

The fourth member of the family and the one that reads backwards from a cloze:
**nothing is missing.** Every word is there and about ten are wrong — "reseev"
for receive, "choose" for chosen, "tropickle" for tropical — each underlined
with a numbered box beside it for the correction.

It is not a variant of a cloze for the same reason `clozebank` and `clozeopen`
are not variants of each other: **what "correct" means is different.** A cloze
blank has several right words; an editing item has ONE properly spelled,
properly formed word. Mark one by the other's rules and a class is told
"tropicle" is fine because it means the right thing.

- **An item stores the printed word AND its corrections**, split on `>>`:
  `[[reseev>>receive]]`, or `[[choose>>chosen|was chosen]]`. **`_edItem` is the
  ONE place** that string is taken apart. Read the halves the wrong way round
  and the correct spelling is printed on the page for the student to copy.
- **No `>>` at all means the wrong word is marked but its correction is not
  written yet** — which is exactly what clicking a word in the editor produces.
  The bracketed text is the PRINTED word; the answer list is empty and the
  passage decides.
- **The printed word is NEVER a correct answer.** It is the error being
  corrected, so `edIsTheError` decides it locally, before the AI is asked — a
  model shown "reseev" against a passage that reads perfectly around it talks
  itself into accepting it. `edAiCorrections` filters it out of the model's
  reply too, and it holds even if an authoring slip lists it as the answer.
- **Near misses are NOT accepted**, unlike the open cloze: this section tests
  spelling, so "recieve" is wrong. The marking prompt says so explicitly.
- The number sits **to the LEFT of the box**, inline, as the paper prints it —
  not hung underneath as the clozes hang theirs. A cloze blank is a thin rule
  with room under it; this box has a border and a height, so a number below it
  lands in the middle of the next line of the passage.
- **`_coText`, not `escapeHtmlKeepLines`**, renders the passage in all three
  cloze-family block types. That helper TRIMS every line, and a passage is split
  at each blank — so the text resuming after one always begins with the space
  that separated it from the word before, and trimmed away every blank is jammed
  against the next word, in all three renderings and on paper.
- Run **`node tools/editing-passage-tests.mjs`** after touching any of it.

## How many questions is a page? (v1.12.0)

A page of **61, 62, 63, 64, 65** holds FIVE questions, not one question with five
parts. ⚡ Rapid add puts five rows in vetting.

**`_aiQuestionPayloads(parsed)` is the ONE place a build reply becomes the list
of questions it describes**, and every path that reads one asks it. Both shapes
work: the old single-question object, and the `questions` array the prompt now
asks for.

- **The rule is the shared stimulus, not the numbering.** Numbered questions
  that share nothing are SEPARATE; a passage, poster or infographic followed by
  numbered questions is still ONE question with lettered parts, because those
  questions cannot be read without it. The prompt gives the model the test in
  one line: *if you deleted every other question on the page, would this one
  still make complete sense?*
- **The paper's number is only the signal.** It is never kept — no `part`, and
  not in any block's text. `_epStripNumbering` runs as a guard on a multi-question
  page, but it only catches the punctuated forms (`61.`, `(61)`): a BARE leading
  number is deliberately left alone, because `EP_LEAD_NUM_RE` refusing it is what
  stops "50 ml of water was added" losing its 50. The prompt carries that case.
- **An entry INHERITS the title / topic / category / tags it does not repeat.**
  A model told to write them per entry writes them once at the top and stops,
  and a question landing in vetting untopiced is one an author must open by hand.
- **An empty or unusable `questions` array falls back to the whole reply**, and
  a reply with no usable blocks at all returns `[]` — Rapid add turns that into
  a visible red card rather than a blank question.
- **Each question is saved as it is built**, not batched at the end: a failure on
  question 4 must not lose the three that already read perfectly.
- **The whole-screenshot B&W backup is single-question only.** On a page of five
  it would give every one of them the same whole-page picture, which is worse
  than no picture at all.
- 🤖 **Build from screenshot loads the FIRST and says so** — the editor holds one
  question, and silently building one of five with nothing on screen to say the
  other four existed is how they get lost.

### ⚡ Rapid add on a PHONE (v1.14.0)

The pad was a paste target and nothing else, so on a phone it was **a box that
could not be filled**: no Ctrl/⌘+V, nothing on the clipboard to paste, nothing
to drag. The camera and the gallery are the way in there.

- **`(pointer: coarse)` is the whole gate**, in the CSS (`.rapid-desk` /
  `.rapid-touch`) and in `_rapidTouch()` for the JS half. On a mouse the pad is
  the box it always was — same wording, same paste, same drop — and a
  touchscreen laptop driven by a trackpad reports a FINE pointer, so it keeps
  the paste pad too.
- **Both routes end at `startRapidJob`**, the ONE queue entry point, so a photo
  is read, split, cropped and filed exactly as a pasted screenshot is. Do not
  give the phone its own pipeline.
- **The picker's `value` is cleared BEFORE the files are queued.** An `<input
  type=file>` still holding last time's file fires no `change` for the same
  photo picked twice, so the second tap does nothing at all — a button that
  looks like it works and does not.
- **An oversized photo is SHRUNK, not refused** (`_rapidPrepFile`,
  `RAPID_PHOTO_MAX_SIDE`). A 12 MP camera photo is several times the size guard,
  so the guard alone refused the phone route for being the phone route. It only
  touches an image over `RAPID_SHRINK_OVER` (4 MB) — a pasted screenshot never
  reaches that and comes through byte-for-byte — and it re-encodes as **JPEG,
  never PNG**, or a photograph comes out bigger than it went in.
- **The size check runs AFTER the shrink**, and a failure there files the same
  red card a failed read does (`_failRapidJob`, which `processRapidJob`'s own
  catch now calls too). A screenshot that vanished silently reads as one that
  worked.

### 📚 The level a BATCH is filed at (v1.15.0)

`rapidLevel` / `setRapidLevel` / `_rapidApplyLevel` / `_rapidLevelOptions`, and
the `#rapidLevelWrap` picker above the pad. An author working through a pile of
screenshots is nearly always working through ONE year's paper, and the AI was
choosing the topic — and therefore the level — one screenshot at a time with no
idea which paper it came from. Saying "these are all P5" once is both less work
and more accurate than correcting forty questions in vetting afterwards.

- **A LEVEL IS NOT A FIELD ON A QUESTION HERE**, and that is the whole design.
  It is read off the TOPIC (`getTopicLevel`), and every surface that cares — the
  bank filter, the student-level gate, the topic grid — reads it that way. So
  stamping `q.level` would write a field nothing in this app looks at, and the
  question would still be served at whatever level its topic belongs to.
  Choosing a level instead **narrows the topics the AI may pick from** to that
  level's, and the level follows from the topic exactly as it always has.
- **`_aiBuildQuestionPrompt` takes the level as a third argument** and blank —
  every other caller, including 🤖 Build from screenshot — leaves the prompt
  byte-for-byte what it was: the whole topic list, chosen from freely.
- **A level whose topics have all been removed falls back to the full list.**
  An empty "choose from EXACTLY this list" leaves the model nothing to choose
  from and it invents a topic instead.
- **`_rapidApplyLevel` is the guard for a reply that ignored the list**, and it
  is what makes the promise true. An off-level or unknown topic is snapped into
  the level and the question is marked **`topicConfidence: 'low'`** — an
  existing signal that already draws the "⚠ check topic" badge in vetting. The
  author asked for a level and gets it; the one thing that had to be guessed —
  WHICH topic within it — is flagged for the glance it deserves.
- **A SECONDARY topic counts too.** `qLevelNum` takes the MAX over both, so a
  `topic2` from a higher level puts the question above the level the author
  chose while the primary topic looks perfectly right.
- **The level is captured in `startRapidJob`, synchronously, as the file is
  queued** — never read inside the job. `_rapidPrepFile` re-encodes a phone
  photo, which takes real time, and the pad stays open the whole while: an
  author who queues a P3 paper and switches the picker for the next one must
  not have the first paper land at P4 because its prep finished second. It is
  carried on the job (and shown on its vetting card) and applied to **every**
  question the page held — a page of five is five questions at that level.
- **It lives in `sessionStorage`**, which is the honest lifetime: a batch is one
  sitting, so it survives a reload mid-pile and is back to "Any level" in a new
  tab or tomorrow. A level that persisted for a week would be the one an author
  set last Tuesday and never noticed again, filing a P3 paper as P5.
- **The options are generated from `TOPIC_LEVELS`**, never typed into
  `index.html`: a level added to the topics and missing from the picker is a
  level nobody can file at.
- The chosen level is **named back in the toast and the status line**. Filing at
  a level and never confirming it is how a whole pile ends up at the wrong one.
- Run **`node tools/subject-level-tests.mjs`** after touching any of it.

### Reading these off a SCREENSHOT

All four are built by **`buildBlocksFromAi`** from rules in
**`_partsPromptRules()`** — one fragment, carried by all four build prompts.
`clozebank` gained its arm in v1.11.0: the block type had existed since v1.6.0
with **no way to build one but typing the whole passage by hand**.

- **Never run a passage through `stripBrackets`.** It exists to pull `[[ ]]` out
  of a model answer; on any of these it erases every blank or item, leaving a
  paragraph that renders and prints perfectly and asks the student nothing.
- **`clozebank`'s bank is DERIVED** (`cbBank` = the answers + the distractors),
  so the model supplies only `extras` — a flat array of strings, because
  Firestore rejects a nested array and `_firestoreSafeQuestion` only rescues the
  table block's rows. A bank missing one of its own answers stays unauthorable.
- **An editing passage's wrong words must be transcribed VERBATIM**, misspelling
  and all. A model that "helpfully" corrects them as it reads destroys the
  question while leaving a passage that looks perfect.

## ✍️ Synthesis & transformation (`sy*`, block type `synthesis`)

The last section of the paper: one or two sentences, a word the student must
use, and ONE rewritten sentence meaning exactly the same thing. *"We admire Mr
Kwan. He is our local football player." + "whom"*.

**It is marked by the AI as one whole sentence, and that is the design
constraint.** There is no marking a rewrite in pieces — the meaning lives in the
arrangement, so a clause correct on its own can still be the wrong answer, and a
sentence differing from the model answer word for word can still be right. The
student writes ONE sentence and the marker receives ONE string.

### On screen it is the PAPER: ruled lines, not a box (v1.9.1)

The paper gives this question two ruled lines with the word provided printed at
one end of the first, and the student writes one sentence across both. That is
what the screen shows: `syLines(block)` clickable rules, the cue printed where
the paper prints it, the closing full stop at the end of the last rule — and
**no square marks box**, which on paper is where a teacher writes a mark and on
screen is furniture.

- **Several boxes, still ONE answer.** `_openAnswerEls(el)` is the ONE place the
  group of rules is resolved, and everything that reads, paints, clears or locks
  an answer asks it. Each of those fails in its own silent way if a rule is
  missed: half a sentence surviving a reset into the next question, a red border
  on rule one and none on rule two, and worst — a second rule still typeable
  after the question has been marked and scored.
- A box with no `data-sy-group` **answers for itself**, which is every other
  question type in the app. They see no change at all.
- Only the **FIRST rule** is the registered `.open-answer` and carries
  `data-oidx`. Two would register one answer twice and mark the student on half
  a sentence, twice over.
- `syLineKey` walks the rules — Enter and ↓ forward, ↑ and Backspace-on-empty
  back, never Tab, and never into a locked rule.

- **It hangs off the EXISTING open-answer plumbing rather than growing its own.**
  It renders an `.open-answer` inside an `.open-answer-section` and registers one
  item in `items`, exactly as `_openSection` does, so every marking path, the
  score, the mistake log, the photo-of-your-page route and `_checkAllPartsMarked`
  cover it without knowing it exists. **Do not add a second marking path.**
- **`syRubric` is the ONE place the marker is told what "correct" means**, and it
  travels on `item.rubric` into both marking prompts. Without it the model falls
  back to comparing wording against the model answer and fails every valid
  rewrite phrased differently — which is most of them. Both prompts say a rubric
  OVERRIDES the default "compare by meaning" instruction for that item.
- **`_openAnswerText(el)` is the ONE place an answer is read**, and both marking
  paths call it. It reads the page in the order the page reads, putting back the
  three things that are PRINTED and therefore never typed. Each one missing marks
  a perfect rewrite wrong in its own way:
  - the given **opening** ("This plot of corn ______"), or the marker gets a
    fragment and says it is not a sentence;
  - the word provided printed **BETWEEN the rules** ("… because of its" / "… or"),
    or the marker reads the two rules run together, cannot find the word the
    question required, and says the connector is missing — the whole question,
    answered correctly, marked wrong (v1.9.2);
  - the closing **full stop**, or it marks a perfect answer down for punctuation
    nobody asked for.

  Each goes back **only where the student has not already written it**
  (`_syAlreadyTyped`): a student may reasonably type the whole sentence on one
  rule, word provided and all, and doubling it — "…football player whom." — is
  the same wrong answer from the other direction. An empty set of rules stays
  empty: printed words alone are never an answer.
- **`cueHere` in `syStudentHtml` decides BOTH the span the student reads and the
  `data-after` the marker reads.** Two expressions could disagree, and that
  disagreement is invisible — the page shows the connector, the marker never
  sees it. Same reason `qPartLabelFirst` is asked by screen and paper alike.
- **`syStudentHtml` refuses a block with nothing given**, exactly as
  `syPrintHtml` does — an item is a markable answer, and one with no question
  behind it is a mark the student can never earn.
- `cuePos` is `'use'` (printed at the end of the rule, the sentence must contain
  it) or `'start'` (the given opening). Only `'start'` writes a `data-prefix`.
- **`QPART_OPENER_TYPES` gained `'synthesis'`** — the block carries its own
  question wording, so labelling it is honest on the printed page.
- **Both print builders carry an explicit `case 'synthesis'`**, for `fillblank`'s
  reason: the read-only rendering shows the model answer, which on a worksheet
  is the whole question given away.
- The PRINTED page **keeps its marks box** (`print-sy-box`). Screen and paper
  differ here on purpose: paper is marked with a pen.
- Run **`node tools/synthesis-tests.mjs`** after touching any of it.

## Word & grammar help on a marked question's options

`wh*` (in `app.js`, search `WORD & GRAMMAR HELP`). Once a multiple-choice
question has been **marked**, every option becomes hoverable — tap the ⓘ on a
touch screen — and the card says two things: what the word or phrase **means**,
and why that word **does or does not work in this sentence** (the tense, the
preposition, the part of speech, the partner word).

The second half is the point of it. `_genAndShowExplanation` writes an A.I.
Explanation only when the question has an OPEN part (`hasOpen`), so before this
an MCQ-only question — most of English grammar practice — ended at a red border
and a green one and told the student nothing about the difference.

- **`_mcqPaintResult` is the ONE painter**, and `whArm` is called from it and
  nowhere else. All three marking paths (`markOpenAnswersIn`, and both branches
  of `markQuestionPart`) carried their own copy of the colouring loop, which is
  exactly how this would have ended up armed on two surfaces out of three.
- **It must never arm before marking.** Hover the four options on an unanswered
  question and the one that "fits" is the one to tick. `resetOpenAnswersIn`
  disarms for the same reason, and the gate is the **`wh-on` class checked in
  `_whOpen`** — not unbinding the listeners, which cannot be done without a
  handle on every closure, and which is why a reset used to leave a question
  that still answered a hover.
- **ONE call covers the WHOLE option list**, through `askGeminiCached` (this is
  its first caller) so the prompt hash is the cache key: the prompt carries the
  question, every option and which is correct, so an edited question can never
  be served the old wording's answers. A failed call **removes** that key — the
  raw reply is already in `sessionStorage`, and if it was the PARSE that failed,
  leaving it makes every retry for the rest of the session fail instantly.
- **An answer is placed against an option by the option's OWN number.** This is
  the one thing here that fails silently: an explanation under the wrong option
  reads perfectly and teaches a child the opposite of the truth. `_whNormItems`
  falls back to positional order **only** when the model numbered nothing at all
  AND returned exactly one entry per option; a partial unnumbered list is
  dropped rather than guessed at.
- **An option with no words gets no badge** (`_whHasWords`). A question whose
  choices read "(1) (2) (3) (4)" against a diagram — the shape ✅ Check
  Questions exists to encourage — has nothing to define.
- Run **`node tools/word-help-tests.mjs`** after touching any of it.

## Printing

- **Printed / PDF worksheet answer boxes** are sized from the MODEL ANSWER by
  `printAnswerLines(block, text)`: `PRINT_ANSWER_LINES` (2) is the floor, a
  one-number / ≤4-word answer (`PRINT_SHORT_CHARS`) gets 1 line, longer answers
  scale at `PRINT_LINE_CHARS` (52) characters a ruled line with a
  `PRINT_HAND_ALLOWANCE` (×1.15) for handwriting, capped at `PRINT_LINES_MAX`.
  Each Claim / Evidence / Reasoning box is sized from ITS OWN field. The answer
  block's "Printed lines" field (`block.printLines`) overrides the estimate;
  blank means Auto. The box `min-height` in the print CSS is one line + padding
  (32pt) — do not raise it. Both print paths — `doPrintWorksheetOpen` and the
  saved-worksheet builder — must stay in step.

- **On-screen picture width** is capped by `IMG_AUTO_MAX_PCT` (70%) inside
  `imgSizeStyle` — the ONE function every rendered picture goes through. It is a
  `max-width` CAP, never a `width`: setting `width:70%` would stretch a small
  inset UP to 70% of the column. A picture the author sized by hand
  (`block.scale`) keeps that size.

- **Printed picture heights** — `.print-question-page img` caps at **92mm**, with
  `print-img-sm` (60mm) / `print-img-lg` (140mm) / `print-img-full` (170mm)
  chosen per picture by the image block's "Print size" control. A question whose
  SINGLE picture is paired with ≤3-character MCQ options is upgraded to Large
  automatically (`imgQuestionNeedsBig`). Do NOT go back to one flat 170mm cap.

- **`.print-text-block img` must not set `max-height`.** That selector has the
  SAME specificity (0,1,1) as the `.print-question-page img` 92mm cap while
  sitting later in the file, so a `max-height` there wins and makes
  `print-img-lg` *smaller* than Auto. The ladder must read 60 / 92 / 140 / 170mm.

- **The print planner must MEASURE, never assume.** `_printPlanIn` lays every
  page out in a print-CSS iframe; a page needing fit-to-page shrinking goes
  through `_printVerifiedZoom`, which re-measures with the zoom applied and steps
  down until the page really fits, falling back to a flowing
  (`print-page-tall`) page at the zoom floor. The page box is a fixed height with
  `overflow: visible`, so any un-verified overestimate paints over the NEXT sheet.
  Five things keep the measurement honest — none optional:
  - **Pictures must reserve their box before they load.** An `<img>` that has not
    decoded occupies ~22px, not the ~350px it prints at, and the planner's iframe
    RE-FETCHES every picture. `_printLearnImgDims` / `_printStampImgDims` stamp
    `width`/`height` onto every printed `<img>`. If anything is still unsized,
    `_printPlanPages` refuses to plan and takes `_printFlowFallback`, which is
    denser but can never overlap. **Never emit a printed `<img>` without dimensions.**
  - **`usable` must reserve the page number.** `.print-page-number` is stamped on
    AFTER planning, so `usable = PRINT_PAGE_PX − numH − PRINT_FIT_SAFETY`.
    `budget` derives from the same ceiling, so the packer and the verifier cannot
    drift apart.
  - **A page promoted to tall must promote its CHUNKS too.** `_printPlanIn`
    writes `cls.tallFlags[idx]` and adds `.print-chunk-tall` for the whole group,
    because a chunk that cannot break on an over-sheet page overflows.
  - **The measuring iframe must get the real fonts.** Both font `<link>`s are
    `media="print"` and the iframe is a SCREEN medium, so copying them verbatim
    measures every stem in fallback metrics. `_printFontLinksHtml` forces
    `media="all"` on the COPIES. Never copy `link.outerHTML` directly.
  - **No box may be taller than a sheet.** `PRINT_LINES_MANUAL_MAX` (24) caps the
    author's override; `_wsBlockLines` / `WS_BLOCK_LINES_MAX` (30) cap the raw
    pixel heights `openLines` / `workingSpace` write.

- **Fill-in-the-blank must print BLANK.** `renderImportedBlockStudent`'s
  `fillblank` branch is `_fbReadonlyHtml`, a REVIEW rendering with the answers in
  the slots. Both print builders carry an explicit `case 'fillblank'` using
  `_fbPrintHtml` and push `_fbAnswerKeyText` onto the key. Do not delete either.

- **EVERY question gets an answer on the printed key** (`_pushBlockAnswerKey` /
  `_qFallbackKeySection` / `_akQuestionSections`). Most answers live in an
  `answer` / `plainanswer` box; the rest do not, and were silently dropped — an
  **MCQ**'s correct option, an **`answerLine`**'s answer, a 🔑 **`answerKey`**
  block. A key that omits a question prints perfectly and looks tidy, so the
  teacher only finds out in front of the class.
  - **`answerKeyExtras` gates EXPLANATIONS ONLY.** An answer is never optional;
    an explanation is teaching commentary and stays behind the flag.
  - **`_pushBlockAnswerKey(sections, block, part)` is the ONE pusher both print
    paths call.** Adding an answer-bearing block type means adding a case there,
    not in two switches.
  - **A question with nothing still gets a ROW** — the explanation stands in
    (labelled *Explanation*), and failing that "No answer recorded for this
    question", because a gap in the numbering reads as a printing fault. The
    placeholder is substituted at RENDER time and is deliberately not what
    `hasAny` counts: a bank with no model answers must still print no key sheet.
  - Run **`node tools/answer-key-tests.mjs`** after touching any of it.

## Question parts — (a) (b) (c)

Parts live on `block.part`. A block carrying a part OPENS it and every block
after it INHERITS until the next opener. Read it with `qPartMap(blocks)` /
`qBlockOpensPart(b)` / `qHasParts(blocks)` — never write a second walker.

- **`block.part === QPART_NONE` (`'-'`) files a block under NO part** — how a
  note about the WHOLE question sits among the parts without lying about what it
  explains. It unfiles **that block only** and deliberately does NOT close the
  part. `qPartUnfiled(b)` is the predicate.
- **An explanation explains the question printed directly above it**, and that is
  enforced for EVERY authoring path:
  - **`qApplyAiParts(blocks)` runs inside `buildBlocksFromAi`** — the one
    function every AI authoring path goes through — in this order:
    `qSplitPartBlocks` → `qLiftPartMarkers` → `qScopeExplanations`. The guards
    keep it safe: splitting needs `<br>` to be the only markup
    (`QPART_ONLY_BR_RE` — the cut is a source offset), lowercase consecutive
    letters, and no `mcq` block; lifting inside an MCQ is allowed only on the
    FIRST text block, because every other lettered line is an option.
  - **The AI buttons write for ONE part.** `aiGenerateBlockExplanation` and
    `aiGenerateBlockAnswer` scope their prompt to the part the box sits in,
    marked `>>>` by `_aiPartScopeLine`, with the other parts as labelled
    background they are told not to write.
  - **Every build prompt carries `_partsPromptRules()`** — keep the four prompts
    pointing at that one fragment rather than restating the rules.
- `qPartDetect` matches a single letter **a–h** at the very start, parenthesised
  or not, closed by `)` or `.`. It stops at `h` on purpose (`i` collided with the
  roman sub-part `(i)`), and a bare `X.` must be LOWERCASE (`E. coli` is prose).
  **`QPART_ASSIGN` is a separate, longer alphabet** for what the editor may
  ASSIGN — detection has to be conservative about unvetted text, an admin
  numbering by hand is not guessing.
- `autoNumberParts` must never write an EMPTY part: `qPartMap` inherits forward,
  so an unlabelled opener is filed under the PREVIOUS part and two answers share
  one heading — the very bug parts exist to prevent.
- **Apply re-resolves each question by id** and checks the block still holds the
  scanned text, then saves a COPY and only commits to `questionBank` on success:
  between scan and apply a question can be edited or deleted.

### The label is drawn from the BLOCK, so it must not also be in the TEXT (v1.17.1)

`qStripOwnPartMarker` / `qPartBodyHtml` / `_qPartOwnMarker` (in `app.js`, search
`THE LABEL IS DRAWN FROM THE BLOCK`).

A block that opens part (a) already wears its label — the chip in the editor,
the tag beside the question on screen, the marker in the margin on paper. When
the SAME marker is also typed at the front of its content the question reads
**"(a) (a) 文中形容…"** on every surface at once.

- **It came in from the AI paths.** The model is asked to letter the
  sub-questions and answers by BOTH stamping `"part":"a"` and writing "(a)"
  into the wording — and `qLiftPartMarkers`, whose whole job is to move a typed
  marker into the field, opened with `if (qBlockOpensPart(b)) return;`. The one
  case it could not fix was the one case that needed fixing.
- **It is handled at BOTH ends, and both are needed.**
  `qStripOwnPartMarker` takes it out of the BLOCK (from `qLiftPartMarkers`, from
  `setBlockPart` when an author labels one by hand, and on `editQuestion` so a
  question tidies itself the moment somebody opens it), and **`qPartBodyHtml`
  takes it out at RENDER** — the bank is already full of questions written the
  other way and nobody will open them one at a time. The render side never
  touches the block, so an author still sees exactly what is stored.
- **The marker must name the block's OWN part.** A block labelled (b) whose
  text opens "(a)" is two people disagreeing about which question this is, and
  that is for a human to look at — not something to tidy away silently.
- **`_qPartOwnMarkerRe` accepts FULL-WIDTH brackets and `QPART_MARKER_RE`
  deliberately does not.** That regex has to find a part in text nobody has
  labelled, where being wrong files a question under the wrong letter; here the
  block already says it is part (a), so a leading `（a）` can only be the same
  label twice. It also drops the `(?=\s|$)` guard **for the bracketed forms
  only**: a 华文 paper writes `（a）文中形容……` with the character hard against
  the bracket, so demanding whitespace there matched none of them. The two BARE
  forms keep it, or `a.` would eat the front of any sentence opening with a
  lone letter.
- **Two markers in one box is refused**, the same guard the Doctor's scan and
  `autoNumberParts` use: that is several parts written into one box, or an
  options list, and neither is fixed by removing the first.
- A **NUMBERED** part is left alone — detection is letters only, on purpose.
- `qPartDetect` now takes an optional regex; its default is byte-for-byte
  `QPART_MARKER_RE`, so nothing else about detection moved.
- Run **`node tools/part-marker-tests.mjs`** after touching any of it.

## Clearing the vetting list — deleting several at once (v1.16.0)

`_vetSelected` / `_vetVisibleQuestions` / `_vetDeleteMany` (in `app.js`, search
`DELETING SEVERAL VETTING QUESTIONS AT ONCE`), plus the tick box on every
vetting card, the `#vetBulkBar` above the grid and **🗑 Delete all** beside
✨ AI Auto-Vet All.

The vetting list is where a whole BAD BATCH lands — forty screenshots off the
wrong paper, an import run twice, a set the model made a mess of. Clearing that
one card at a time is forty confirm dialogs, which is why it gets left instead,
and a vetting list nobody clears is one nobody reads either.

- **"All" means every card the author can SEE.** `_vetVisibleQuestions` is the
  ONE place that set is worked out — filtered by the search box, newest first —
  and the cards, the tick-all box, 🗑 Delete selected and 🗑 Delete all all read
  it. Deleting questions hidden behind a filter is the one outcome nobody could
  have predicted from the button they pressed, so the confirm **says which of
  the two it is doing** and how many are being spared.
- **The deletes are AWAITED, one document at a time** (`deleteVettingDocAwait`,
  the awaited twin of the fire-and-forget `deleteVettingDoc`). A batch has to be
  able to report that four of forty would not go, and a question leaves
  `vettingList` only once its document really went — the same order every other
  move in this app uses. A list that has dropped a question the database still
  holds looks perfectly right until the next sign-in.
- **The selection is PRUNED on every render** (`_vetPruneSelection`). A ticked
  question approved into the bank, edited away or auto-vetted out is not a thing
  to delete; doing it in the renderer rather than in each of those paths is what
  covers a path added later. "3 selected" outliving the cards it counted is how
  the wrong question gets deleted.
- **The ticks live in a `Set` of ids, never as a flag on the question.** Those
  objects are replaced wholesale by re-reads and cross-tab syncs, which would
  silently drop the tick.
- **`.vet-pick` must set `appearance: auto`** — Tailwind's preflight sets it to
  `none`, which leaves an invisible white square exactly where the control the
  author is looking for should be. The usual trap.
- A ticked card's outline **outranks** the duplicate / just-added one while it is
  ticked and gives it back when unticked: both are inline styles, so one has to
  win outright rather than being layered.
- **This delete is FINAL — it does not go through the 🗑 bin.** It is the same
  `deleteVettingDoc` the single card's 🗑 has always used, and the confirm says
  so in as many words. A vetting draft that should be kept is approved into the
  bank, where deleting *is* a move to the bin.
- Run **`node tools/vetting-bulk-delete-tests.mjs`** after touching any of it.

## "You may already have this one" — the duplicate warning (v1.17.0)

`findDuplicateCandidate` / `checkEditorDuplicate` / `dupWatchKick` /
`_dupGateSave` (in `app.js`, search `THE DUPLICATE WATCH`), plus the
`#dupWarnBanner` at the top of the question editor and the 🟡 badge on a
vetting card.

The matcher itself is old: a token-overlap (Jaccard) score over the title, the
body and the MCQ options, past `DUP_MIN_SCORE` (0.7). What was missing was
everywhere it was not being asked.

- **It used to be raised from ONE place — straight after 🤖 Build from
  screenshot.** So a question TYPED into the block editor, pasted, built by the
  passage builder, or opened and reworked was checked against nothing at all,
  and the only duplicate warning in the app was a badge on a Rapid add card.
  The bank fills up with the same question twice and nothing anywhere says so.
- **The banner is LIVE.** `dupWatchKick` re-checks as the author works, so the
  warning is on screen while there is still something to do about it. The
  listener is **ONE delegated pair on `#page-create`**, for the reason the 拼音
  IME's is: this app builds the editor's DOM continuously, so anything bound
  per element covers the fields that existed when it ran and silently misses
  every one made afterwards. **`renderBlocks` kicks it too** — a builder writing
  blocks programmatically fires no `input` event at all.
- **The SAVE asks as well, and that is the backstop.** A banner sits at the top
  of a long editor and the Save button is at the bottom, so `_dupGateSave` is on
  all three editor saves — ✅ Add to vetting, 💾 Save, and Save straight to the
  bank. It is a **PROMPT, never a block**: only the author can tell a real
  duplicate from two questions that merely share a stem, so "Save anyway" is
  always there.
- **The gate is a PASS-THROUGH, never a second write path.** Each save function
  keeps its body in a `*Confirmed` twin, so answering "Save anyway" ends at the
  same door — and therefore the same ordering guarantees — as before.
  `tools/question-persistence-tests.mjs` pins that.
- **The VETTING LIST is searched as well as the bank**, and the result says
  which (`_dupWhereLabel`). The commonest duplicate of all is the same
  screenshot read twice in one sitting, and BOTH copies are then in vetting,
  where a bank-only search sees neither — nothing was flagged, and the pair was
  approved into the bank one after the other.
- **`_dupStillThere` is the ONE place a suspected twin is checked for existence**,
  and it reads both lists. The vetting card used to ask `questionBank` alone, so
  a twin that is itself still in vetting made the badge vanish.
- **The banner's 👁 button ASKS before it leaves** (`dupOpenOriginal`). The
  banner is on screen while the author is mid-compose, so loading the twin
  replaces the draft they are looking at; hovering the same button previews a
  BANK twin without leaving at all, which is the answer most of the time. The
  vetting card's copy of the button needs no guard — nothing is being typed
  there — which is what the third argument to `_dupSeeOriginalBtn` selects.
- **The hover preview is attached only for a BANK twin.** `ppBankHoverHtml`
  reads `questionBank` and nothing else, so a vetting original would open an
  empty card that reads as a broken preview.
- Run **`node tools/duplicate-warning-tests.mjs`** after touching any of it.

### ⇄ Side by side — the comparison the warning was missing (vv1.19.0)

`dupCompare` / `_dupFindQuestion` / `_dupCompareSide` / `_dupDiffHtml`
(search `SIDE BY SIDE`), plus the `#dupCompareOverlay` in `index.html`.

The banner said *"this looks 90% like Sharing a Sum of Money"* and offered
exactly ONE button: **open** that question. Which replaces the draft — so the
only way to answer the question the banner asks (*are these two the same?*) was
to throw away the thing being compared, go and look, and then build it again
from memory. Nobody does that, so the warning got clicked past, which makes it
a warning that costs attention and buys nothing.

The two questions now go up **next to each other**: what is being written on the
left, what is already filed on the right.

- **Both sides go through the SAME renderer** — `renderQuestionBodyPreviewHtml`,
  split out of `renderQuestionPreviewHtml` so it takes the question OBJECT
  rather than an id, because the left-hand column is a draft that has never been
  saved and has no id to look up. A second renderer written for this view would
  be free to drift, and a comparison whose two halves are drawn by different
  code can flatter one of them.
- **Nothing is written and nothing is replaced by opening it.** It is a read.
  The one destructive action — loading the original into the editor — lives in
  the overlay's foot, still behind `dupOpenOriginal`'s confirm, and is now
  reached only by somebody who has actually seen what they are about to lose. It
  is **hidden** when the left-hand side is a saved question (a vetting card),
  because there is no draft to lose there.
- **`mineId` names the LEFT-hand question.** A vetting card passes its own id;
  the editor banner passes nothing, and the draft is read from
  `_dupEditorQuestion()`. That third argument to `_dupSeeOriginalBtn` used to be
  a boolean `guard` — same position, different meaning, so check both call sites
  if you change it.
- **It says what differs IN WORDS** (`_dupDiffHtml`, through the matcher's own
  `_dupTokenSet`). Two near-identical questions are near-identical to LOOK at,
  which is the whole problem: the eye slides straight over the one changed
  number. The words appearing on one side only are the fastest honest answer to
  "so what did they change?", and a diff computed on any other footing would
  contradict the percentage printed above it. When both lists are empty it says
  *word for word the same*, which is the strongest thing it can tell an author.
- Run **`node tools/duplicate-warning-tests.mjs`** after touching any of it —
  the direction of the difference strip is the silent one: reversed, the two
  lists read perfectly and tell the author the opposite of the truth.

## ✂️ What counts as INK, and the sentence above the figure (v1.27.0)

`_inkThreshold` / `INK_RATIO` / `_expandRectToWhitespace` / `_trimEdgeTextLines` /
`MAXRUN_FRAC` / `RUNS_MIN` / `RULE_FRAC` / `RULE_GROUPS` (in `app.js`, search
`WHAT COUNTS AS INK`). **`polymathlc/cer`, `polymathlc/math` and the other language portal carry the
same block byte-for-byte — ship a change to all
four together**; `polymathlc/scan` carries the same statistic under its own
names (`_mbInkLevel`, `_mbTrimTextRows`).

Both pixel passes asked *"is this pixel darker than 190?"*, and on a SCREENSHOT
— white at 255 — that is exactly right. **⚡ Rapid add has taken camera
photographs since v1.290.0**, and a photograph of the same worksheet is grey:
the paper measures 180–200, the light slopes across the sheet, and 190 reads the
whole page as ink. Both passes then find one band covering everything and do
nothing at all — on every photograph, with nothing on screen to say they have
stopped working, and the crop quietly back to being whatever rectangle the model
happened to draw.

- **So the line is MEASURED.** `_inkThreshold` takes the paper's own white as
  the **98th percentile** of the luma over the rectangle being worked on, and
  ink is `INK_RATIO` of that or darker. The top 2% is given away deliberately:
  one specular highlight off a glossy sheet is 255 and is not what the page is
  made of, so the maximum would put the line highest on exactly the photographs
  that need it lowest. It is measured **locally**, over the crop rather than the
  sheet, which is also what makes it survive a shadow gradient across the page.
  On a clean screenshot it lands within a few levels of the old 190, so nothing
  about the screenshot path changes; a region it cannot read falls back to
  `INK_DEFAULT`, which IS the old 190.
- **A band is prose on FIVE counts now, and the last two are what stop a table
  or a graph being eaten a row at a time.** `MAXRUN_FRAC`: every scanline
  through print crosses letters, so the longest unbroken run of ink in a line is
  a few pixels — while an axis, a table border, a leader line or the top of a
  rectangle lays a run right across the band. **Density alone cannot see that**:
  a hairline rule across a wide crop is a fraction of a percent of its row's
  pixels, so the old "not solid" test passed it happily and the top came off the
  table. `RUNS_MIN`: a line of print breaks into dozens of separate runs, a
  stroke or a blob into one or two.
- **A FRAMED TABLE is not trimmed at all.** `RULE_GROUPS` full-width rules in
  one crop is a ruled table, whose every row is short, wide and full of letters —
  prose on every count that reads a row on its own, and trimmed row by row it
  comes back as its own bottom two thirds, which is the one wrong crop that
  looks completely convincing. **Four rules and not three**: an ordinary boxed
  diagram is a rule top, a rule bottom and a divider across the middle, and at
  three this would stand down on half the figures it was written to clean.
- **A RUN OF CONSECUTIVE LINES goes together.** Two lines of a question sit a few
  pixels apart, far less than the clear band that separates the wording from the
  figure — so insisting on clear paper after the FIRST line finds none, stops,
  and leaves both lines on the picture. The cut is remembered only where a run
  reached real whitespace, so a band with nothing but figure after it is still
  never touched.
- **AND THEN THE BLANK PAPER ITSELF.** Whatever survives, the edges are pulled in
  to the first and last row with any ink in it. It is the one move here that
  cannot be wrong — it removes measured empty paper and nothing else — and it is
  what `_expandRectToWhitespace` structurally cannot do, because that one only
  ever grows.
- **`_aiRefineCrop` is unchanged and still runs on top.** These passes are free,
  instant and deterministic; the AI pass costs a call per figure and catches what
  pixels cannot. Neither replaces the other.

### 🔢 Picture answer options are ONE picture

`_rectangleRules()` said, flatly, to EXCLUDE the answer options from every
rectangle — right when the options are words, and the reason a question whose
four choices are little DRAWINGS came out of Rapid add with its choices missing
altogether. The rule now has two cases, and the picture case asks for **ONE
rectangle round all four together** with their (1) (2) (3) (4) labels. Four
separate rectangles would lose the row they were printed in, come out at four
different sizes, and stop reading as a set of choices — a student answering
"(3)" cannot see which one (3) was. It needs nothing downstream: it is one more
ordinary `image` block, so `_autoFillDiagramsFromBoxes` crops it like any other.
`polymathlc/scan` sends the same thing as a block wearing `role: 'options'`,
because its viewer prints a word list underneath and has to know to stop.

## Authoring surfaces that must not be merged

- **📄 Exam Paper** (`ep*`) takes a whole paper the way a teacher has one:
  question screenshots ONE AT A TIME, the marking scheme SEPARATELY, and the
  paper's own answers slotted in by **question number**.
  - **Nothing is written until Send.** The paper sits in `_epShots` /
    `_epKeyShots` in memory; `_epCommit` is the only writer and it goes through
    `saveQuestion` / `saveVettingQuestion` like every other path.
  - **Screenshots are read as a RUN, never one question per screenshot.**
    `_epRunBuild` sends `EP_BATCH` (4) at a time as multiple images in ONE
    `askGeminiVision` call. Reading is always a read of the WHOLE set — adding or
    removing a screenshot sets `_epDirty` and asks for a re-read.
  - **The paper's question number never reaches the question**
    (`_epStripNumbering`). `EP_LEAD_NUM_RE` ends in `(?!\d)` or "2.5 kg of ice"
    opens with what looks like question 2; a bare leading number needs a `.`/`)`
    after it, so "50 ml of water was added" survives.
  - **The link between a question and its answer is `_epNumKey(number)`**, which
    collapses `Q12 (b)`, `12b` and `12(B)` to one key. Every unmatched question
    gets a per-row `<select>` in the ③ Match table.
  - **A question with parts is matched PART BY PART** — the paper numbers ONE
    question while the scheme answers (a), (b), (c) separately. `_epApplyAnswer`
    places each answer **inside that part's own run of blocks**, never on top of
    the next part's. A question matched on only SOME parts is **partial** and
    both the ③ table and the Send dialog say so.

- **🖊️ Mark Paper** (`mp*`) is the exam-paper builder read backwards: the same
  paper once a student has WRITTEN on it.
  - **It is not Snap & Mark.** Snap & Mark is the STUDENT's tool — one photo, one
    question, matched against a question that must already be in the bank. A
    marked script is thirty questions the bank has never seen, so the questions
    here are read off the paper itself.
  - **The answer key has three sources, best first, and every row says which**:
    🔑 the paper's own marking scheme, 📚 a bank question that is plainly the
    same (`_mpBankMatch`, a cheap token overlap with `MP_BANK_MIN_SIM` at 0.62
    because a wrong match marks the student against the wrong question), then 🤖
    the model's own answer. A teacher checking a mark has to know which.
  - **Reading and marking are separate passes.** `_mpReadScript` sends
    `MP_READ_BATCH` (3) pages in one vision call and is told to transcribe, never
    to mark; `_mpMarkAll` then marks from the transcription in text-only calls.
  - **Nothing is written anywhere.** A marked script is a child's work; it lives
    in memory and leaves through `mpPrintReport` / `mpCopyReport`.
  - Guards: an unmarked question defaults to 1 (MCQ) / 2 (written); `awarded` is
    clamped to `[0, marks]`; a `correct` verdict earns FULL marks; a blank answer
    can never be correct; a batch whose AI call FAILED renders `unmarked` with a
    note rather than a silent zero.

- **✅ Check Questions** (`cq*`) serves the newest questions back one at a time
  for a second pair of eyes. It is not the Question Doctor: the Doctor is a
  whole-bank audit read as a LIST, this is a QUEUE worked newest-first.
  - **The headline check**: a question whose TABLE OR DIAGRAM already sets out
    the four choices, with the options underneath repeating them in words. Those
    should read just **(1) (2) (3) (4)**.
  - **Two layers find it, and neither can do the job alone.** Structurally it is
    decidable only when the choices are in a `table` block. The same question
    with a **picture** is invisible to any text check, so the AI pass attaches the
    diagrams (`_cqMedia` → `askGeminiVision`). **Do not "optimise" that down to
    `askGemini`** — without the images the check cannot be made.
  - **The one-tap fix must never be a guess.** `_cqMcqFixable` gates it on a real
    option list that is not already numbered; the button blanks the wording of
    all four options, so offering it on a question whose choices are NOT in the
    picture destroys the question while looking tidy. The picture-only case
    raises a low-severity nudge with **no fix button**.
  - **`q.checked` lives on the QUESTION, not per user**, and is written with a
    **quiet** save — reading a question is housekeeping, not authoring. It is
    deliberately absent from `EDITOR_OWNED_QUESTION_FIELDS`.
  - Run **`node tools/check-questions-tests.mjs`** after touching any of it.

## 🗑 The bin — deleting a question is a move, not a delete

A question is somebody's work: a screenshot cropped, an answer written, a
diagram touched up. So every real deletion in the app is a **move**
(`questionsEn` → `binEn`, `binQuestion`), restorable in one tap for `BIN_DAYS`
(7), after which the next sign-in sweeps it for good.

- **`binQuestion(id)` is the ONE deletion path** — the bank card's 🗑, the
  Question Doctor's, and ✅ Check Questions' all go through it. `deleteQuestionDoc`
  is the raw hard-delete and stays that way, because two of its three call sites
  are **moves to vetting**, not deletions; binning there would leave a copy in
  the bin of a question that is still very much alive.
- **Copy → read the copy back → delete the original**, the same order as the
  legacy bank rescue. If the copy cannot be verified the question stays in the
  bank; if the *original* cannot be deleted the bin copy is rolled back, because
  a question in both places is worse than a question that refused to delete.
- **A binned question is OUT of `questionsEn`.** It is not a flag on a live
  question — no practice mode, worksheet, search or student can reach it. A
  saved worksheet that referenced it draws its "no longer in the bank" row, and
  restoring puts it back.
- **`binExpired` KEEPS a record whose date it cannot read**, and that asymmetry
  is deliberate: keeping one too long leaves a row in a dialog with a *Delete
  forever* button beside it, while sweeping one too early destroys work in a
  background job with nothing on screen to show it happened. `_binExpiryMs`
  accepts **only an ISO string** for the same reason — `Date.parse` coerces, and
  `Date.parse(12345)` is the *year 12345*, so a numeric timestamp would read as
  perfectly healthy and sit in the bin for ten millennia.
- **The purge is client-side** — there is no server — so it runs when an author
  next opens the app, not on the stroke of the seventh day. `binDaysLeft` is
  therefore what the bin PROMISES (never *less* than 7 days), not a countdown.
- **The confirm dialog is on the bank and the Doctor, and deliberately NOT in
  Check Questions.** That queue is worked at speed with one big button and an
  ↩ Undo in view at all times; a dense list of small 🗑 icons is a different
  risk. `cqUndo` covers the deletion *and* the last ✓, newest first.
- `_firestoreSafeQuestion` is shared with `saveQuestion` — Firestore rejects
  nested arrays, so a table question written to the bin without it fails to save
  at all. Run **`node tools/bin-tests.mjs`** after touching any of it.

## Image touch-up & the transform session

- **Touch up & label** (`_annotXform*`) is ONE session shared by Resize (F),
  Rotate (R) and Skew (K): the selected pixels are lifted onto their own layer
  and nothing is committed until Apply, so 30° and back to 0° leaves the pixels
  as sharp as they started. The transform is **scale → skew → rotate**, and
  `_annotXformMapper` and `_annotXformDrawInto` must apply it in that order or
  the handles drift off the picture they are drawn on.
  - Resize drags the eight handles round the box: the corner OPPOSITE the one
    being dragged is the anchor, so the maths runs in the **M-frame**
    (`_annotXformMFrame`), where the new factor is just
    `(pointer − anchor) / handle-span`. Only the axes a handle actually DRIVES
    get a vote when "keep shape" is on, and `_annotXformRecentre` puts the pivot
    back in the middle after every resize or move.
  - A pointer arrives in CANVAS coordinates and the transform lives in the
    pre-offset frame, so anything comparing the two goes through
    `_annotXformUnoffset` or a grown canvas breaks the hit test.
- **The brush cursor is a RING at the real size of the mark**
  (`ANNOT_RING_TOOLS` / `_annotUpdateBrushRing`). The tools that take no size
  show no ring, and `_annotUpdateBrushRing` only touches `canvas.style.cursor`
  for a tool that IS in `ANNOT_RING_TOOLS`, or it fights the resize handles'
  own cursors. The ring lives in the STAGE, never on the canvas (which is scaled
  and panned underneath it). `_annotSyncControls` is the ONE place every route to
  the size lands, so the "12 px" badge flashes from there.
- **A picture can be PASTED straight in** (`_annotPasteHandler`). Ctrl+V drops it
  on the canvas scaled to fit (`ANNOT_PASTE_FIT`, 90%) and opens the transform
  box with **Resize already in hand**.
  - It is its **own transform scope, `paste`** — the pixels do not come off the
    canvas, so Cancel leaves no trace.
  - **`_annotXformIsIdentity` must return false for a paste**, or a picture
    dropped at 100% and 0° is read as "nothing to do" and silently thrown away.
    That is the one bug this scope can produce, and it looks exactly like the
    paste never happened.
  - The handler is bound in **capture**, because the exam paper builder, Mark
    Paper and the contenteditable guard all listen for `paste` underneath.
- **`_annotPaintCompose` sets the composite mode for a WHOLE stroke** and
  `_annotUp` puts it back; `_annotSetTool` resets it too — a canvas stranded in
  `destination-out` erases everything drawn afterwards.
- **Annotation answers** — an annotation pad carries its own answer on the block:
  `answerImg` is a screenshot of the diagram WITH the correct annotations,
  `answerKey` the same in words. All three consumers read the BLOCK, not the
  question: `annotShowAnswer`, `annotAiCheck` (which sends the screenshot as a
  SECOND picture so the AI compares two diagrams), and `_pushAnnotAnswerKey`.

## Roles

**admin / employee / student.** `EMPLOYEE_EMAILS` names accounts hired to WRITE
QUESTIONS: they get exactly `EMPLOYEE_PAGES` and nothing else. Two rules keep it
default-deny — `configureSidebarForRole('employee')` hides every `.nav-item` and
shows back only those pages, and `navigateTo` rewrites any other page to `create`
(hiding nav items alone would leave a bookmark walking straight in). **Anything
that switches a nav item on after sign-in must ask `_navAllowed(page)` first.**

Gate authoring on **`_canAuthor()`** (admin OR employee), never by widening
`_isAdmin()`. An employee has **no bank of their own**: `_bankOwnerUid()` points
`_qCol`/`_vCol` at the teacher's subtree, so `_resolveBankOwner()` must run (and
`adminUid` be set) before anything reads or writes. Employees must never write
the bank pointer — that is what students resolve the bank from. An employee must
be created with their REAL email; the dialog refuses an address not already on
`EMPLOYEE_EMAILS`. The `role` written to the profile is descriptive only — the
live role is decided at sign-in.

## Work sessions and concurrent tabs

- **The clock is two timestamps, never a counter.** `_wkElapsed` =
  `(endedAt || pausedAt || now) − startedAt − pausedMs`, so a minimised tab, a
  throttled `setInterval` or a sleeping laptop cost nothing. Do not "fix" it by
  accumulating ticks — that is the exact bug this shape prevents.
- `lastSeen` is a 60-second heartbeat meaning *the tab was demonstrably open at
  this moment*, and it is where an abandoned session is closed. Hours when
  nobody was at the keyboard are not hours worked.
- **Questions are logged from `saveQuestion` / `saveVettingQuestion`** — the two
  functions every committed question goes through. `opts.quiet` writes are
  excluded and `_wkSuppress` guards the automatic paths. **Both flags are read at
  CALL time into a local `wkLog`, before the `await`.**
- **One session covers ALL the author's windows, and every write MERGES.**
  `_wkMerge` must stay **idempotent**: items union by question id, `savesByTab`
  counts per tab, `pauseSetAt` decides whose pause is current, any `endedAt`
  wins. `uniq` is DERIVED from the merged list, never incremented.
- `xtInit()` opens a **BroadcastChannel**, falling back to a `localStorage` key.
  Messages are **hints, never data**: a tab is told an id changed and re-reads
  that document, so two tabs cannot talk each other into a state the database
  does not have. `_xtFlushQuestions` debounces (500 ms), **reads first and
  applies after**, and a read that FAILS changes nothing.
- `_xtTabId()` lives in **`sessionStorage`** — per-tab, kept across a reload.
  That is exactly what the exam paper draft needs; don't move it to localStorage.
- **The exam paper draft is mirrored to IndexedDB** (`_epDraft*`) so an unsent
  paper survives a reload. Three records per draft — `epmeta:` (a few numbers, so
  a scan never pulls another window's 90 MB of screenshots into memory),
  `epwork:` and `epshot:` (rewritten only when `_epShotsSig()` changes). Keyed by
  **tab**, never by user.

## Learning objectives

Filed from BOTH ends: from the objective's end (the 🎯 page writes
`loData.map[loId]`) and from the question's end (the editor's 🎯 field writes
`q.los`). **`loQuestions(id)` reads both and dedupes** — that is what makes them
one system. `loDetachQuestion` clears both ends, or the question reappears on the
next render.

- Nothing is written until the question is saved; `los` is in
  `EDITOR_OWNED_QUESTION_FIELDS` or `carryOverQuestionMeta` restores an objective
  the author just removed.
- **`var editorLos`, not `let`** — the block sits near the END of the module and
  `navigateTo('create')`'s reset can reach `loEditorSet` before it is evaluated.
- **`qLos(q)` drops an unknown objective at READ time, and only once the list has
  LOADED** — otherwise a question opened before the list arrives comes back from
  the editor stripped of every objective it had, and is saved that way.
- Run **`node tools/objective-tag-tests.mjs`** after touching any of it: every
  failure here is silent.

## Saved worksheets

A saved worksheet is nothing but an ORDERED list of bank ids (`ws.questionIds`),
so the editor (`wse*`) edits that list and everything else follows.

- It **never touches the question bank** — it only adds and removes references.
  Editing the question ITSELF is the quick-edit drawer (`wsQuickEdit`).
- **Every change persists as it is made** (`_wsPersistWorksheet`): a list of ids
  is a tiny write, and an edit the teacher believes is saved and is not is far
  worse than a chatty connection.
- Removing must also drop the id from `wsManualBreaks` / `wsMergeUp` — those
  overrides are keyed by question id.
- The **whole-paper editor** renders each question through **`buildOpenBody`**,
  the same renderer every student surface uses, so the preview cannot drift. Each
  row needs its OWN container selector — buildOpenBody keys its answer stores by
  selector, and the same selector twice clobbers the first question's answers.

## Versioning convention — applies to EVERY change

1. **Bump the version.** In `app.js`, update `const APP_VERSION = 'vX.Y.Z'`.
   Patch bump for fixes, minor bump for new features.
2. **Keep it visible.** It renders in the sidebar footer for admins only
   (`#appVersionBadge`, class `admin-only`).
3. **Report it.** When summarising an update in chat, always state the new
   version number (e.g. "Shipped in **v1.0.3**").

The point: the user checks the version shown in the sidebar against the number
reported in chat, to know whether the deploy actually went through.

## Design convention — breathing space

- Give elements room to breathe: generous, consistent padding inside
  cards/banners, clear vertical spacing between title → description → meta →
  buttons, comfortable line-height. Never cram content edge-to-edge.
- Cards/banners are rounded rectangles constrained to a sensible max-width (not
  full page width) and centred.
- When the user says something is "too big/thick/messy", the fix is usually
  *more* whitespace and a tighter width, not shrinking fonts until it's cramped.
- Keep the spacing scale consistent so every surface feels like one design system.

## 📊 The Student Usage Tracker (v1.20.0)

`USAGE_MODES` / `usageMode` / `_sut` / `sutRender` / `sutVisible` / `sutByMode` /
`sutExportCsv` (in `app.js`, search `THE STUDENT USAGE TRACKER`), plus the
`#studentDetailOverlay` and the `.sut-*` CSS in `index.html`. Opened by clicking
a student anywhere on the Usage page. **All four portals carry the same block —
keep them in step**; only `ATTEMPTS_COL` and the mode table differ.

Every question one student has completed, the result they got, and the **mode**
they did it in. The attempt log was always being written; what was missing was a
way to READ it. The old drill-in listed the rows and nothing else, so a teacher
looking at four hundred attempts could not answer either of the two questions
they actually have — *what has this child been doing?* and *how are they getting
on in it?* A list that can only be scrolled is a list nobody reads.

- **`USAGE_MODES` is the ONE place a raw mode string becomes words.** The log
  stores `quickpractice-open`, `snapmark-open`, `gap-generated` — internal names,
  not English. The chip, the breakdown, the filter dropdown and the CSV all read
  that map, so they cannot drift apart. A mode with **no entry still shows**, as
  its own raw string in the `other` group, rather than being dropped or folded
  into "Unknown": an unlabelled mode is a missing label, but a question dropped
  out of the log because nobody wrote a label for its mode is a **missing
  question**, and two unlabelled modes merged into one row is a breakdown that
  lies.
- **A GENERATED question needs its label more than any other row.** A
  learning-gap retry is never saved to the bank, so `sutQuestionMeta` can never
  resolve a title for it — without `gap-generated` / `retry-generated` in the
  table, a teacher reads a row called "Question a7f3…" and has no idea what the
  child did.
- **The breakdown BY MODE is the headline, not the log.** "43 in Quick Practice
  at 71%, 12 gap retries at 50%" is what a teacher opened this for; the
  row-by-row log is the evidence underneath it. Practice modes sort ahead of
  everything else, so the real schoolwork is read before the AI's stand-ins for
  it, even when there are more of those.
- **It renders from state.** `_sut` holds the attempts and the filters and
  `sutRender()` paints the whole overlay from them, so changing a filter never
  re-reads Firestore. `closeStudentDetail` clears `_sut.uid`, which is also what
  makes a reply from a superseded load harmless.
- **`sutVisible()` is the ONE place the window is decided**, and the count, the
  table, the breakdown and the CSV all read it. A CSV holding more rows than the
  table it came from is a teacher sending a parent a report of work in a mode
  they had filtered away.
- **The verdict threshold is the app-wide ≥0.95** that `progressOnMarked` and
  `lgNoteWin` already use, and `sutCredit` is FRACTIONAL — a half-marks open
  answer is **part right**, its own verdict, never rounded into a pass or a fail.
- **The title and topic are resolved from the BANK at read time**
  (`sutQuestionMeta`), not trusted from the attempt: an edited question would
  otherwise wear its old title in the log forever. A question **deleted since**
  is marked *removed from the bank* and keeps its row — the work was still done.
- It reads `ATTEMPTS_COL`, never a spelled-out collection name — see **Where the
  data lives**. It is otherwise **READ-ONLY**: nothing in the block writes
  anything anywhere.

## The clone stamp shows what it is about to stamp (vv1.18.0)

`_annotClonePeekSrc` / `_annotUpdateClonePeek` / `ANNOT_PEEK_MIN` and the
`#annotClonePeek` canvas inside `#annotBrushRing` (search `The clone stamp's
live preview`).

The source pin says where the copy comes FROM and the brush ring says how big
the mark will be. Neither says what the mark will BE, so lining a stamp up
meant clicking and then looking at what landed — and undoing it when it was
half a letter out. **The ring is now filled with the patch that would be
stamped this instant**: a lens on the source, carried under the pointer, at the
same zoom as everything else.

- **It lives INSIDE the ring**, so it is positioned, sized and hidden by exactly
  the code that already does all three for the ring. `_annotUpdateBrushRing` is
  still the ONE place either of them moves.
- **The source point is different before and during a stroke, and getting that
  backwards is the silent failure.** Before the first dab there is no offset, so
  starting the drag here is what would put the source POINT under the pointer —
  the preview is centred on `cloneSrc`. Mid-stroke the offset was locked in at
  pointer-down, so it is `(pointer in image px) − cloneOff`, which drifts away
  from the mark at the speed of the hand if it is computed the other way round.
- **`_annot.ptr` is in STAGE coordinates and the source is in IMAGE pixels**, so
  zoom and pan come off first. Read it raw and the preview is right only at 100%
  with no panning — which is how the editor opens, and therefore how anyone
  would check it by hand.
- **Mid-stroke it reads `cloneSnap`, not the live canvas** — the stamp reads the
  frozen snapshot, so dragging back over ground already covered would otherwise
  preview the copy instead of the source, and the two diverge exactly where it
  matters.
- The backing store is the brush in **image** pixels, so the preview is
  pixel-for-pixel what the dab puts down however far the view is zoomed; under
  `ANNOT_PEEK_MIN` (14) screen px there is nothing to see in the ring and it is
  not drawn. The ring goes white-on-black while it is previewing — a black
  hairline over arbitrary artwork is the one thing that disappears.
- Run **`node tools/clone-preview-tests.mjs`** after touching any of it.

## ✨ Regenerate — say what you want and the AI redraws it (vv1.18.0)

`annotAiRegen` / `_annotAiBarInit` / `_annotAiSyncScope` / `_annotSelBox` /
`ANNOT_AI_KEEP` (search `REGENERATE`), plus the `#annotAiBar` under the
selection bar in the Touch up editor.

AI content-aware fill answers exactly ONE question — *take this out* — with a
prompt nobody can change. Everything else an author actually wants of a picture
("rub out the pencil marks", "make the arrow red", "redraw this beaker
cleanly", "put the missing axis label back") had **no door at all**. This is
that door: a line to type in, and the same image model behind it.

- **TWO SCOPES, and the difference between them is the whole safety story.**
  With an area SELECTED only that area may change: the model is shown the
  picture with the area **RINGED rather than blanked** — "make the arrow red"
  needs the arrow still visible, which is exactly what content-aware fill's
  magenta blanking destroys — and the reply is composited back through
  `_annotWithSelClip`, so a model that quietly rewrote the whole page cannot
  touch one pixel outside the selection. With NOTHING selected the whole picture
  is redrawn, which is the honest reading of "no area chosen".
- **The bar NAMES the scope it is about to use** (`_annotAiSyncScope`, kicked
  from `_annotSelSyncBar`), because those two are very different things to press
  a button on.
- **The magenta marker is drawn just OUTSIDE the selection**, so it never covers
  the content the instruction is about — and anything of it that survives into
  the reply is outside the clip and therefore cannot be composited back.
- **It is ONE history step either way**, so ↶ Undo puts the original back. That
  is what makes an experimental prompt cheap enough to actually experiment with.
- The whole-picture branch **clears the canvas and draws**, never a `'copy'`
  composite: a canvas stranded in a composite mode erases everything drawn
  afterwards (the same trap `_annotResetCompose` exists for).
- `_annotAiBarInit` runs on every open, so **last picture's instruction is never
  left sitting in the box** one Enter away from being run on this one.

## ✍️ AI complete — carry the paragraph on from where you stopped (v1.21.0)

`completeBtnHtml` / `_aicTrimEcho` / `_aicJoin` / `_aicUnquote` / `_aicAppendInto`
(search `✍️ AI COMPLETE`), plus the ✍️ **AI complete** button beside ✨ Improve
and ✂️ Shorten on every prose box in the question editor. **All four portals
carry the same block — keep them in step**; only the subject line of the prompt
differs.

An author half way through writing a passage, a model answer or an explanation
had two AI buttons and both of them *rewrote what was there*. Neither is any
use to somebody who has stopped mid-sentence and wants the rest — so the thing
they actually wanted, they typed themselves.

- **It only ever ADDS, and that guarantee is STRUCTURAL rather than something
  the prompt asks for.** ✨ Improve and ✂️ Shorten hand their reply to a setter
  that REPLACES the whole box; `_aicAppendInto` appends, and the existing markup
  is never re-serialised. So nothing the model returns can change a word that is
  already there — and the author's own bold, underline and pasted pictures
  survive, which a plain-text round trip would flatten.
- **`_aicTrimEcho` is the net, because the model restates before it continues.**
  Asked to carry on, it very often repeats the last sentence first, and now and
  then the WHOLE paragraph. Appended verbatim that puts the author's opening in
  the box twice, which reads exactly like the button having mangled it. Whatever
  of the existing text the reply opens with is cut — matched on
  whitespace-folded, lower-cased text so a reply that reflows the spacing is
  still caught, and **longest tail first**, or a shorter match leaves the rest of
  the repeat behind.
- **The other direction is the one that eats the work.** A trim firing on a
  coincidental few characters throws the real continuation away, so
  `AIC_ECHO_MIN` (10) is the floor below which an overlap is treated as
  coincidence. Both directions are silent and the app works either way.
- **`_aicJoin` never welds a space between two CJK characters.** 中文 and 华文 are
  written without them, so a space there is a space in the middle of a word;
  latin either side needs one, and a trailing space the author typed is not
  doubled. It is in all four portals, not just the Chinese one — a 华文 name or
  a quoted phrase turns up in any of them.
- **execCommand is what makes it cheap to try**: it keeps the browser's own undo
  stack, so ONE Ctrl+Z takes the whole completion back off again. The caret is
  moved to the END of the box first — appending at the caret (which is what
  🎤 Dictate does) would drop a completion into the middle of a sentence.
- **An empty box is refused.** Writing from nothing is a generated question,
  which is a different job and a different button; this one carries on from what
  is there.
- **The model is told to finish ASKING a question, never to answer it** — a stem
  the author is still writing must not come back with its own answer appended.
- **It shares `.improve-btn` for its looks, so ✨ Improve's handler needs a
  guard.** Improve is the one that runs on the bare class; without
  `contains('complete-btn') return` one press runs BOTH, and Improve rewrites the
  box — the exact damage this button promises never to do, delivered by the
  button itself. ✂️ Shorten has carried the same guard from the start.

## 📷 A question that came off a photograph (v1.22.0)

`_vetIsScanned` / `SCANNED_SOURCE` (search `A QUESTION THAT CAME OFF A PHOTOGRAPH`), plus
the purple outline and the **📷 From the Scan app** badge on a vetting card.

The Scan app (`polymathlc/scan`) reads a worksheet or an exam paper on a phone.
The teacher can now send any question it read straight into **this app's
vetting list** — `users/{uid}/vettingEn` — and it arrives as an
ordinary pending question with one extra field.

- **`source: "scan"` is the whole contract between two repositories that
  cannot see each other**, and it fails silently in both directions. Rename
  the value on either side and the card still arrives, still renders and still
  approves; it simply stops being purple and stops saying where it came from,
  with nothing anywhere to say so. **Ship a change to the word in all five
  repos together** (`scan`, `cer`, `math`, `english`, `chinese`).
- **It has to be LOUD, because a scanned question is not like a typed one.** It
  was read by a model from a picture of somebody's worksheet: the wording may
  be half a line short, **the diagram is not there at all**, and the topic
  is left blank on purpose (it belongs to the topic list that app has never
  seen), so it arrives flagged `topicConfidence: 'low'` and wears the
  existing ⚠ check topic badge.
  A card that looked like every other draft would be approved at the same speed
  as one somebody typed and checked, and reach the bank with a figure missing.
- **`_vetIsScanned` is the ONE predicate**, and the outline and the badge both read
  it. Two tests would drift into a card that is purple with no badge (which
  reads as a styling bug) or badged with no outline (which is the warning made
  invisible).
- **Three outlines compete for one border, so they are RANKED rather than
  layered (`restBorder`): a possible duplicate is the thing to look at first,
  then where the question came from, then merely that it is new — and a card
  ticked for deletion outranks all three. They are all inline styles, so one
  has to win outright.**
- **It lands in VETTING and nowhere else.** The Scan app writes one document
  into this app's vetting collection and touches nothing else — not the bank,
  not a student's progress, not the notebook. Approving it is the ordinary
  approve, and from then on it is an ordinary question.
- **The child's work never travels.** The Scan app marks what the student wrote
  on the paper; none of that is in the document. A bank question is the
  QUESTION, its options, its answer and why.
- Run **`node tools/scanned-question-tests.mjs`** after touching any of it.

## ⚙️ Choosing the AI engine — three routes, and the key is on the SERVER

`AI_DOWN_MS` / `_aiDown` / `_aiWhy` / `aiEngineOrder` / `askOpenAiServer` /
`askChatGpt` / `_aiRun` / `_aiAsk` / `askGeminiDirect` / `aiRouteReport` /
`renderAiEngineStatus` / `aiEngineChoicePreview` (in `app.js`, search
`THREE ROUTES`), plus `#aiEngineStatus` in the AI Engine chooser. **All the
portals carry this same block — keep them in step.**

All the apps answer through Gemini on the shared `mathgen--app` project, so
when that project's billing cap is hit they **all die at once and
identically** — `[429] Your billing account has exceeded its monthly spending
cap`, on every call, on every device, until the month turns over.

- **THE ORDER IS THE DESIGN**: Gemini, then **ChatGPT on the SERVER**, then
  ChatGPT on a key pasted into this browser. The chooser reverses it. That is
  what choosing an engine now means: **which is tried FIRST, never which is
  available.**
- **The failover used to go ONE WAY, which is why it never helped.** The old
  code fell from ChatGPT to Gemini and never the other way — so the failure
  that actually happens, a capped Gemini, had nothing behind it at all.
- **THE SERVER ROUTE IS WHAT MAKES THE CHOICE REAL.** `askOpenAiServer` calls
  the `askOpenAi` Cloud Function in `polymathlc/math/functions`, which holds
  the key as a Firebase secret and enforces the sign-in, the model, the size
  caps and a daily quota. Before it existed, choosing ChatGPT needed a key
  pasted into every device separately — so it worked on the teacher's laptop
  and **no student's phone**, which is the half of the school that matters. A
  key cannot be shipped in `app.js` instead: this is a public static site
  served to every student's browser.
  - **It needs one deploy**: `firebase functions:secrets:set OPENAI_API_KEY`
    and a functions deploy in the Maths repo. Until then the call returns
    `failed-precondition` and the chooser says **in those words** that the
    server key is not switched on yet — a deploy step and a rejected key are
    different problems, and an app that reported both as *AI error* would send
    the teacher looking in the wrong place.
- **A key in `localStorage` is the THIRD route, not the first.** It is what
  keeps ChatGPT working before the function is deployed, or if it ever stops
  answering, and it is still shared with the other portals. The chooser says
  so rather than presenting it as the fix, and **no longer refuses to save a
  ChatGPT choice without one**.
- **`openai` is ALWAYS in the order.** Whether the function is deployed is not
  something a page can know without asking; one refused call marks it down for
  `AI_DOWN_MS` rather than being paid for again on every page of a bulk
  import. `__aiReady()` is therefore simply `true` — an app that asked "is
  Gemini up" would refuse every AI button on a capped project that can in fact
  answer.
- **A refused route goes to the BACK of the list, never off it**: a cap is
  lifted eventually, and refusing on a stale note is worse than spending one
  call finding out. A success clears the mark.
- **When every route refuses, the FIRST error is thrown.** It names the real
  problem; the last is usually "no key on this device".
- **`askGeminiDirect` is the raw Gemini call, written once.** Both doors used
  to carry their own copy of it, and both carried their own copy of the
  one-way ChatGPT fallback too.
- **The chooser SAYS what is actually happening** (`renderAiEngineStatus`),
  because an app quietly running on its second route looks exactly like one
  running on its first, and an app with nothing behind its first looks like
  both. It reports only what it knows: the routes in the order they will be
  tried, and what each said the last time it refused.
  `aiEngineChoicePreview` shows the order a radio would produce **without
  committing it** — a preview that saved would make Cancel a lie.
- Run **`node tools/ai-routes-tests.mjs`** after touching any of it.

### The engine choice belongs to the CENTRE, not to a browser

`aiPreferredEngine` / `aiEngineLoadShared` / `aiEngineSetShared` /
`_aiSharedEngine` / `AI_SHARED_TTL`, and the `aiEngineConfig` callable in
`polymathlc/math/functions`.

A device-local engine choice was the bug wearing a feature's clothes: the
teacher switched to ChatGPT on their own laptop, watched it work, and **every
student stayed on the capped Gemini** — with the screen on the machine they
set it on looking exactly as it should. So the admin sets it once and every
signed-in device follows until they set it back.

- **It is a CALLABLE, not a Firestore document the clients read.** The shared
  `firestore.rules` in the Maths repo does not contain the Science app's own
  rules — it carries a placeholder telling you to paste them in from the
  console first — so **any** rules deploy from there is a manual assembly job
  with the whole project's access as the blast radius. A new world-readable
  document would need exactly that. The function writes through the Admin SDK,
  which bypasses rules, so the shared setting costs no rules change at all:
  the deploy that switches ChatGPT on switches this on with it.
- **Reading is open to any signed-in user; WRITING is the admin's alone**, and
  it is checked in the function — the dialog's own gate is not a lock.
- **`_aiSharedEngine` is null until the callable answers**, and the device
  preference stands in until then. A project where the function has never been
  deployed behaves exactly as it always did, rather than waiting on a call
  that is never coming.
- **A write that FAILED is reported.** A teacher told nothing would believe
  the whole centre had moved. The message names the missing deploy when that
  is what it is.
- **The page says WHOSE setting is in force** — centre-wide, or this device's
  own because the shared one could not be read.

### Where the shared setting lives — and why it is not a new document

`_aiCfgRef` / `aiEngineWatchShared` / `aiEngineStopShared` (v1.321.0). The
engine is a **field on this app's own admin-pointer document** — the one every
signed-in device already reads to find out whose question bank to load, and
that only the admin can write.

- **So it needs NO rules change and NO deploy.** Both the read and the write
  are paths this app has exercised in production since it shipped. A brand-new
  document would have been tidier and would have needed a rules deploy — from
  a file that does not even contain this app's own rules — so tidier was not
  worth it.
- **The write is a MERGE, always**, and so is the admin sign-in write that
  puts `uid`/`email` on the same document. A plain set on either would take
  the other's field off: the bank pointer, or the engine setting the teacher
  set that morning. The sign-in one was a plain set until v1.321.0, and it
  would have wiped the toggle every day.
- **It is a LIVE listener, not a poll**, so a device with the app open follows
  the teacher within seconds. That is what app-wide has to mean.
- **It comes down on sign-out**, or one account's engine setting goes on
  governing the next person to sign in on the device — the same rule the
  teaching-notes listener carries.
- **An unset field means Gemini**, the default every app already had, so a
  centre that never touches this is unaffected.
- **The `aiEngineConfig` callable is kept as the FALLBACK** for the case where
  the direct read or write is ever denied: it goes through the Admin SDK,
  which bypasses rules.

### When nothing answers, say what everything said

`AI_ROUTE_LABEL` and the tail of `_aiAsk`. The first error is kept as `cause`,
but the message names **every** route: `Gemini: … · ChatGPT (server key): …`.

Reporting only the first hides the rest. A card reading *"Gemini: your billing
account has exceeded its monthly spending cap"* and nothing else sends the
teacher to the Google console — when what actually needs doing is deploying
the ChatGPT function. That is a real hour lost, and it is exactly what
happened.


### 🌙 Kimi — the THIRD engine, and why two was not enough

`AI_ENGINES` / `_aiRoutesFor` / `askKimiDirect` / `askKimiServer` / `askKimi` /
`kimiListModels` / `_kimiModelNote` / `KIMI_DEFAULT_MODEL` (in `app.js`, search
`KIMI (Moonshot AI)`), plus the third radio, the model box and the key box in
the AI Engine dialog. **All the portals carry the same block — keep them in
step.**

Gemini and ChatGPT are two suppliers on two bills, so "whichever will answer"
has never been more than one deep. The morning the Firebase project is capped
**and** the OpenAI account is out of credit is a morning that happens, and it
used to leave every app in the family dead at once. Kimi is a third company,
a third account and a third cap.

- **An ENGINE is one or two ROUTES, and that shape is now the whole order.**
  `AI_ENGINES` is the three a teacher chooses between; `_aiRoutesFor` turns
  each into the routes it actually has — the server's key, and behind it a key
  pasted into this browser. The chosen engine's routes go first and **the other
  two stay behind them**, which is what makes a capped supplier survivable
  rather than fatal. An engine name nobody recognises still yields every route
  rather than an empty list: a stale word in the shared setting would otherwise
  take the AI off every device at once.
- **`askChatGpt` had to stop meaning "not Gemini".** It was
  `filter(e => e !== 'gemini')`, which was right with two engines and is
  silently wrong with three — 🔍 Answer key cross-check asks for a **named**
  second opinion, so a ChatGPT column quietly answered by Kimi is two engines
  agreeing in the report and one engine agreeing with itself in fact. Both
  `askChatGpt` and `askKimi` are filtered to their OWN routes now.
- **A PDF is REFUSED BY NAME, never dropped.** A PDF is an OpenAI `file` part
  and Moonshot has no such part, so `askKimiDirect` throws rather than sending
  a request without its pages — which would come back fluent and about nothing
  at all. The loop then falls to a route that can read it, which is the whole
  point of the loop.
- **THE MODEL IS A FIELD, NOT A CONSTANT**, and this is the failure mode to
  design for: Moonshot renames its flagship with every release (`kimi-k2-…`,
  `kimi-k3-…`), so an id hard-coded on the day this shipped is a 404 on every
  call a few months later — and a 404 on every call reads as "Kimi is broken"
  rather than "the id is a release out of date". 🔄 **Load models**
  (`kimiListModels`) asks the account itself, and **`_kimiModelNote` says it in
  words** in the chooser's status panel. `KIMI_DEFAULT_MODEL` is only what an
  admin who has never opened the box gets.
- **The server route is what makes the choice real**, exactly as it is for
  ChatGPT: `askKimi` is a callable in `polymathlc/math/functions` holding
  `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` as a Firebase secret, so a student's phone uses it with
  nothing set up on it. **It needs one deploy** —
  `firebase functions:secrets:set MOONSHOT_API_KEY` and a functions deploy —
  and until then it returns `failed-precondition` and the chooser says *the
  server key is not switched on yet* rather than *AI error*.
  - It is the ONE callable in that file that takes the **model** from the
    client, because a teacher cannot redeploy a Cloud Function to follow
    Moonshot's renames. `KIMI_MODEL_RE` is what keeps that from becoming "a
    client naming an expensive model on the centre's bill": it can only ever
    be a Moonshot id, and anything else falls back to the server's own.
  - Its throttle counts on **its own fields** (`kimiDay` / `kimiCount` /
    `lastKimiAt`). Sharing ChatGPT's would mean a capped ChatGPT day silently
    closing Kimi too — on exactly the day Kimi is the one engine still
    answering.
- **The key is NEVER in the repo.** These are public static sites served to
  every student's browser. The harness fails on an `sk-`-shaped string in the
  source, and that check now covers every engine's key rather than OpenAI's.

## The printed part label reserves its OWN width (v1.27.1)

`PRINT_PART_PAD_MIN` / `PRINT_PART_PAD_PER_CH` / `PRINT_PART_PAD_GAP` /
`PRINT_PART_PAD_MAX` / `printPartPadPt` / `printPartBlockHtml` (in `app.js`,
search `THE PRINTED PART LABEL RESERVES ITS OWN WIDTH`), plus the
`.print-text-block.print-has-part .print-part-label` rule in `index.html`.

A block that OPENS a part hangs its label in the margin, and the label is
positioned **out of the flow** — so the block has to RESERVE the room with
`padding-left`. That reserve was a flat **26pt**, which is exactly the room
`(a)` needs and nothing like the room a numbered part like `(21)` needs. A wider label printed
**straight over the first words of its own question**, on every surface that
uses the print CSS at once: both print builders and the live A4 preview.

- **The reserve is MEASURED FROM THE LABEL**, and `printPartBlockHtml` is the
  ONE place a printed part label and the block carrying it are built. It
  writes the same number into both — the padding the text starts at, and the
  width of the label's own box — so **they can never disagree**. Two
  expressions computing that width separately is exactly how they drift back
  apart, and the symptom is a label sitting on top of a sentence on paper,
  which nobody sees until a class is in front of it.
- **`(a)` is unchanged, byte for byte.** `PRINT_PART_PAD_MIN` IS the old 26pt,
  so the overwhelming majority of the bank prints exactly as it always did —
  and the print planner, which measures the finished page, re-plans around the
  wider blocks for free.
- **`PRINT_PART_PAD_MAX` bounds it.** A label allowed to grow without limit
  would eat the column rather than the question; past the cap it wraps inside
  its own box instead, which is what `overflow-wrap` in the CSS is for.
- **`box-sizing: border-box` on the label is load-bearing.** Its width is the
  same number as the block's padding, so without it the padding-right would
  push the label's box past where the text begins and put the overlap back.
- **`min-height: 17.6pt` on the block stays.** The label is out of the flow, so
  a block that carries a part and no text of its own measured zero tall — the
  marker painted over whatever came next and contributed nothing to the
  planner's chunk height.

## House rules
- After touching **the printed part label** (`PRINT_PART_PAD_*`,
  `printPartPadPt`, `printPartBlockHtml`, or the
  `.print-text-block.print-has-part` rules), print a question with parts and
  LOOK at the page. Both directions are silent and nothing throws: too little
  reserve and the marker prints on top of the first words of its own question,
  too much and the label eats the column the question is set in. And the two
  numbers — the block's `padding-left` and the label's `width` — must keep
  coming from the one call, or they drift apart and the overlap comes back on
  whichever surface was not looked at.
- After touching **the AI routes** (`aiEngineOrder`, `askOpenAiServer`,
  `askChatGpt`, `_aiRun`, `_aiAsk`, `askGeminiDirect`, `AI_DOWN_MS`, `_aiWhy`,
  `aiRouteReport`, `renderAiEngineStatus`, `aiEngineChoicePreview`, or
  `askGemini` / `askGeminiVision`'s wrappers) — **or the `askOpenAi` function
  in `polymathlc/math/functions`, which is the other half of it** — run
  `node tools/ai-routes-tests.mjs`. Every failure is silent and the app looks
  exactly as it did the morning the spending cap was hit. The server route
  dropping out of the order is the whole feature reverting: a key in
  localStorage rescues the teacher's laptop and no student's phone, so it
  looks healthy to the one person who would notice and to nobody else. A
  one-way fallback leaves the failure that actually happens with nothing
  behind it. A "down" note that never clears makes the second route
  permanent, and one that takes a route OFF the list leaves the app dead once
  the cap has been lifted. And the second error reported instead of the first
  tells the teacher "no key on this device" about a paper that hit a billing
  cap. And `askChatGpt` filtered to "not Gemini" rather than to ChatGPT's own
  routes puts Kimi in the cross-check's ChatGPT column, which reads as two
  engines agreeing and is one engine agreeing with itself.
- After touching **📷 a question that came off a photograph** (`SCANNED_SOURCE`,
  `_vetIsScanned`, `SCANNED_CARD_BORDER`, `SCANNED_CARD_BADGE`, or the
  `restBorder` ranking in `renderVettingList`), run
  `node tools/scanned-question-tests.mjs`. One word — `source: 'scan'` — is the
  whole contract with `polymathlc/scan`, and every way it goes wrong is silent:
  rename the value and the card still arrives, still renders and still approves,
  it simply stops being purple and stops saying it came off a photograph. A
  scanned question has no diagram and no topic, so a card that looks like every
  other draft is approved at the same speed as one somebody typed and checked —
  and reaches the bank with the figure missing.
- After touching **the Student Usage Tracker** (`USAGE_MODES`, `usageMode`,
  `sutCredit`, `sutVerdict`, `sutQuestionMeta`, `sutVisible`, `sutByMode`,
  `sutExportCsv`), run `node tools/usage-tracker-tests.mjs`. Every failure here
  is silent and a teacher acts on it: a mode that falls out of the log is a
  child's work made invisible, a verdict threshold that drifts from the app-wide
  0.95 makes the tracker and the progress counters disagree about the same
  answer with nothing to say which is lying, and an export that reads a
  different window from the table it came from sends a parent a report of work
  in a mode the teacher had filtered away.
- After touching **✍️ AI complete** (`completeBtnHtml`, `_aicTrimEcho`,
  `_aicJoin`, `_aicUnquote`, `_aicWords`, `_aicAppendInto`, `_aicPrompt`, or
  ✨ Improve's `complete-btn` guard), run `node tools/ai-complete-tests.mjs`.
  Every failure is silent and lands in the middle of writing somebody was part
  way through: trim too eagerly and the real continuation is thrown away or
  starts halfway through a word, too timidly and the author's own opening is in
  the box twice, and lose ✨ Improve's guard and one press of ✍️ AI complete also
  runs the button that REWRITES the box.
- After touching **the clone stamp's live preview** (`_annotClonePeekSrc`,
  `_annotUpdateClonePeek`, `ANNOT_PEEK_MIN`, `_annotUpdateBrushRing`), run
  `node tools/clone-preview-tests.mjs`. A preview that does not appear is
  obvious the first time anyone picks the tool; a preview centred on the WRONG
  source point looks exactly like a working one and aims every stamp a little
  way off — which is worse than the pin-and-guess it replaced.

- After touching **the crop's pixel passes** (`_inkThreshold`, `INK_RATIO`,
  `_expandRectToWhitespace`, `_trimEdgeTextLines`, `MAXRUN_FRAC`, `RUNS_MIN`,
  `RULE_FRAC`, `RULE_GROUPS`) or **`_rectangleRules()`**, check a crop of a
  photographed page as well as of a screenshot. Every failure here is silent and
  the question is still built: a fixed ink level is right on a screenshot and
  reads a whole PHOTOGRAPH as ink, so both passes find one band and stand down on
  every phone picture ⚡ Rapid add takes — the crop back to whatever rectangle the
  model drew, with nothing on screen to say so. In the other direction a trimmer
  that cannot see a long stroke takes the top row off a table, the axis labels off
  a graph and the caption off the picture it names, and all three look like a
  perfectly successful crop. The same block is in `polymathlc/cer`,
  `polymathlc/math` and the other language portal — ship a change to all four
  together.
- After editing `app.js`, validate it:
  `cp app.js /tmp/c.mjs && node --check /tmp/c.mjs` (the `.mjs` copy makes Node
  parse it as a module, so `import` at the top is accepted).
- **The Gemini model is `AI_MODEL` and its thinking floor is `AI_THINK_MIN`, and
  the two move TOGETHER** (v1.2.0). Every model has its own thinking scale, and a
  level it does not know is a **400 INVALID_ARGUMENT on every AI call in the
  app** — not a degraded answer, no answer at all. `gemini-3.7-flash` takes
  `low` / `medium` / `high` and **dropped the `"minimal"` 3.6 accepted**, exactly
  as 3.x had already dropped 2.x's numeric `thinkingBudget`. So the floor is a
  named constant used at every call site rather than a string typed out in three
  places, and swapping the model means checking its scale first. The Science app
  (`polymathlc/cer`) carries the same pair — keep the two in step.
- Run the twenty-three harnesses after touching what they cover — every failure they
  catch is **silent**, with nothing thrown and nothing wrong on screen:
  - `node tools/answer-key-tests.mjs`
  - `node tools/journey-board-tests.mjs` — 🏆 the Journey leaderboard. There is
    money on this board and every way it goes wrong is silent: apply accuracy
    once instead of squaring it and the board is won by rattling through, badge
    the all-time top three and the voucher is offered to the wrong people, let
    a row clamp the wrong way and one claiming five right out of nothing
    answered out-ranks real work, and drift the month key by an hour and a run
    answered on the 31st lands in a month the board is not showing.
  - `node tools/journey-quiz-tests.mjs` — 🐒 the between-rounds question gate
    in `journey/`. Loosen its allowlist and a student mid-battle is handed a
    comprehension passage — the one thing that gate was asked never to do;
    tighten it past the real bank and the gate quietly stops using the
    teacher's questions for ever and runs on its built-in set, on a card that
    still names its source and a teacher who never looks. An unticked MCQ
    served here marks a whole class against a word nobody chose.
  - `node tools/check-questions-tests.mjs`
  - `node tools/part-marker-tests.mjs` — the doubled part marker. Both
    directions are silent: too timid and every AI-built sub-question prints its
    letter twice ("(a) (a) 文中形容…"), too eager and it eats the front of the
    question — "（见图一）文中形容…" opens with a bracket and is prose, and a
    block labelled (b) whose text opens "(a)" is a disagreement somebody should
    see rather than have tidied away.
  - `node tools/duplicate-warning-tests.mjs` — the duplicate warning. It fails
    silently in both directions and the app works perfectly either way: too
    tight and it never fires (a question re-read off the same paper is never
    worded byte-for-byte the same), too loose and it fires on every save, which
    makes it a warning nobody reads and lets the real duplicate through behind
    it. It also pins that the VETTING list is searched — the commonest
    duplicate of all is the same screenshot read twice in one sitting, and both
    copies are then in vetting where a bank-only search sees neither.
  - `node tools/vetting-bulk-delete-tests.mjs` — clearing the vetting list.
    This is the most destructive button in the app and every way it can go
    wrong is silent: 🗑 Delete all reading `vettingList` instead of the
    VISIBLE set destroys the questions the author had filtered away and never
    saw, and a question dropped from the list on a delete the database refused
    leaves a page that looks tidy and a question that is back at the next
    sign-in.
  - `node tools/usage-tracker-tests.mjs`
  - `node tools/objective-tag-tests.mjs`
  - `node tools/learning-gap-tests.mjs`
  - `node tools/bin-tests.mjs` — the bin's calendar and stored record, plus the
    `_firestoreSafeQuestion` helper every save shares. A day counted wrong
    purges somebody's question early, in a background sweep, with nothing on
    screen; a field lost on the way in is a question that comes back broken a
    week later with nothing left to compare it against.
  - `node tools/bank-rescue-tests.mjs` — the one-time rescue's topic verdicts.
    Wrong in one direction it leaves an author's questions in the other app and
    reports nothing to move; wrong in the other it offers a one-click **delete
    from the Science bank**. It also pins the premise the whole heuristic rests
    on: that the two subjects' topic lists share no entry.
  - `node tools/word-help-tests.mjs` — which OPTION each of the model's answers
    is about. Line them up wrong and the popout still opens, still looks right
    and still reads fluently, while telling a child that "reluctantly" cannot be
    used because it is an adjective.
  - `node tools/synthesis-tests.mjs` — the rubric the sentence-rewrite marker
    is given, and the printed opening being put back before marking. Lose the
    rubric and a correct rewrite worded differently from the model answer is
    marked wrong; lose the prefix and the marker judges a fragment.
  - `node tools/ai-parts-tests.mjs` — the `"part"` the AI puts on a block, and
    that the typed-marker pass leaves it alone. Drop it and a comprehension page
    is eight option lists in a row with nothing telling them apart, on a screen
    that still looks right.
  - `node tools/passage-cloze-tests.mjs` — the passage builder's parse, the
    cloze's word bank, and the part lettering both rest on. A passage split
    one line early swallows the first option list; a question number read off a
    quantity cuts the passage in half; a bank that does not contain one of its
    own answers renders and prints perfectly and is unanswerable.
  - `node tools/rapid-split-tests.mjs` — how many questions a page holds. Split
    a passage question and its sub-questions lose the passage they are about;
    fail to split a page of five and four questions are silently thrown away,
    leaving one row in vetting that looks perfectly fine.
  - `node tools/editing-passage-tests.mjs` — the editing passage's
    `[[wrong>>right]]` split, the rule that the printed word is never a correct
    answer, and the screenshot path into the drag-and-drop cloze. Read the split
    backwards and the correct spelling is printed for the student to copy; let
    the printed word count as an edit and copying the error out earns the mark.
  - `node tools/open-cloze-tests.mjs` — the open cloze's accepted-answer list,
    what is marked right without the AI, and the passage the marker is sent.
    Drop an alternative and the word is marked wrong while the key still lists
    it as acceptable; send the blank without its passage and there is no way to
    judge it; let `stripBrackets` near the passage and every blank vanishes into
    a paragraph that looks perfectly fine and asks the student nothing.
  - `node tools/subject-level-tests.mjs` — the subject switcher's four links and
    ⚡ Rapid add's batch level. A url pointing at the wrong folder does not
    error, it loads the WRONG subject's app, and `../science/` is a 404 for the
    whole school (the folder is `cer`). An absolute url is the same failure
    delayed until the centre moves domain. And the batch level has no field to
    check itself against — a level is read off the TOPIC here, so if the
    narrowing stops working the picker still says "filed at P5", the toast
    still says "at P5", and forty questions land wherever the AI's topic put
    them.

### Two CSS traps in `index.html`

- **`.confirm-dialog` is declared LATE** and sets `max-width: 400px`, `padding`
  and `text-align: center`. A new dialog variant that only adds a second class
  earlier in the file silently loses all three. Use `.confirm-dialog.your-variant`
  (both classes) for anything that clashes.
- **Tailwind's preflight sets `appearance: none` on form controls**, so a bare
  `<input type="radio">`/`checkbox` renders as an invisible white box. Set
  `appearance: auto` (plus `-webkit-`) on any you add, or draw your own.
- **A `<button>` does not inherit `color`** the way a div does — it falls back to
  the browser's own button text. Any card-shaped button must set
  `color: var(--text)` itself, or its child text is invisible on a dark surface.

## The fork

This repo was created from `polymathlc/cer` by removing the game layer:
the RPG hero, the dungeon, the arcade, the Realm of Embers trading-card game,
Ember Duel / Siege / Legends, Science Strike, the game leaderboards, points,
packs, prizes and game credits — about 20,000 lines of `app.js` and 1,200 CSS
rules. What replaced the hero doc is the small **Learner progress** store above.

Do not port the games back. If you are copying a fix across from the Science
repo, take the teaching-side change only, and remember that the two apps use
different collection names (see **Where the data lives**) and a different
`topicLevelMap` / `SYLLABUS_LO_TOPICS`.

The **Textbooks** page is also absent: it embedded a file of Science content with
no English equivalent.

## 🐒 Journey to the West — the game, and the question gate inside it (v1.28.0)

`journey/` is a copy of the `polymathlc/journey` repository: a 100-chapter
Wukong action roguelite in ONE self-contained `index.html` (48 MB, with every
sprite and every sound base64'd into it). It is reached from the sidebar's
🐒 link and served from `journey/index.html` — its own page, not a page of this
app. `journey/README.md` is the game's own manual.

What this repo added to that copy is **the between-rounds question gate**
(search `THE BETWEEN-ROUNDS QUESTION GATE` in `journey/index.html` — it is in
two pieces, the game-side half in the main script and the bank reader in a
`<script type="module">` at the foot of the file).

Clearing a chamber opens three gates, and stepping into one used to hand the
reward over on contact. It asks **three short English questions** first.

- **Every right answer heals `JQ_HEAL` (10) health, at once.** It is the only
  healing in the game a student can decide to earn.
- **The number they get right is the upgrade tier (0–3), and it makes the
  reward BETTER**: a divine boon arrives that many ranks higher, a peach raises
  the rank by that many more, and the three plain gates pay
  `JQ_SHOP_GOLD`/`JQ_HEART_HP`/`JQ_ASHES` more each. **Getting none right is
  the game exactly as it was** — the gate never punishes, it only pays, and the
  summary card says so in as many words.
- **The card says what the tier is worth BEFORE it is claimed**
  (`jqRewardBlurb`). A bonus a student cannot see is a bonus that taught them
  nothing.

### The questions are the teacher's own, and the allowlist is the feature

`window.JourneyBank` reads `users/{adminUid}/questionsEn` — the same bank the
portal serves, resolved through the same `enConfig/admin` pointer, with the
same App Check. The game is on the same origin as the portal, so a student
signed in next door is already signed in here.

- **`quizUsable` is an ALLOWLIST, never a list of things to skip**: a question
  is usable only when it is short wording plus exactly ONE multiple-choice
  block. Every longer thing this portal can hold — a comprehension passage set,
  a cloze of any kind, an editing passage, a synthesis rewrite, an open answer,
  a table, a picture, a question with (a)(b)(c) parts — falls out of that rule
  without being named, so **a block type added to the portal next month is
  excluded here by default** rather than quietly served to a student standing
  in a doorway with a horde on the other side.
- **An unticked MCQ is refused.** Guessing which option is right would mark a
  whole class against a word nobody chose, on a card that reads perfectly.
- **It READS the bank and writes nothing to it.** The only write is one
  attempt row per bank question, under the mode **`journey-quiz`** in
  `enQuestionAttempts`, so the work shows in the teacher's usage tracker like any other
  mode. That label is in `USAGE_MODES` in `app.js`: a mode written from OUTSIDE
  `app.js` needs it more than most, because an unlabelled row reads as a mode
  somebody forgot rather than as a game.
- **Nothing is level-gated, deliberately.** The level of a question is read off
  its TOPIC through `topicLevelMap`, which lives in `app.js` — and a copy of
  that map inside a 48 MB game file is a copy that silently drifts. The gate is
  a between-rounds warm-up, not a graded practice mode, so it draws from the
  whole bank instead.
- **No bank, no sign-in, no network, or a bank of nothing but passages all fall
  through to the BUILT-IN practice set** (`JQ_BUILTIN`) rather than to a gate
  that cannot be opened — and **the card says which of the two each question
  came from**. A student told these are their teacher's questions when they are
  not learns to distrust the whole gate.

### The card is drawn in a SHADOW ROOT, and that is load-bearing

The game runs a MutationObserver over `document.body` that pushes every text
node through its own Chinese→English glossary while the language is English
(`localizeTextNode`). A question put in the ordinary DOM is silently rewritten
by that glossary — measured, a 华文 stem came back with 写**法** turned into
"写Spell", 气血上限 into "Max Health" and 第 3 章 into "Chapter 3": four
plausible options and a student answering something their teacher never asked.
The observer does not walk into a shadow root, so the whole card is drawn in
one. **Do not move the question text out of it.**

### Other things that hold it together

- **`jqBusy` is what keeps the game loop out.** The gate test runs every frame
  and the card takes seconds to answer, so without it a single step into a gate
  opens a new quiz sixty times a second.
- **The two gates that grant on the spot must hand the pause back**
  (`needsResume` in `jqGrantGate`). The quiz opened the pause, so the quiz has
  to close it — the three modal rewards take it over themselves, and the other
  two would otherwise leave the run frozen on an empty screen.
- **The tier is taken ONCE** (`jqTakeBonusRanks`), so a peach bought in the
  shop later in the same chamber is a purchase rather than this gate's prize
  all over again.
- **The sidebar link is a plain `<a class="nav-item">` with NO `data-page`.**
  `navigateTo` knows nothing about it, an employee's default-deny sweep hides
  it (`dataset.page` is `''`, which is on no `EMPLOYEE_PAGES` list), and the
  bookmark stars query `.nav-item[data-page]` and skip it.
- Run **`node tools/journey-quiz-tests.mjs`** after touching any of it. Every
  failure is silent: loosen the allowlist and a student mid-battle is handed a
  comprehension passage, tighten it past the real bank and the gate quietly
  stops using the teacher's questions for ever, and a draw that cannot serve
  past the bank's own size stops asking half way through a 100-chapter run and
  turns the gate back into a doorway.

### The gate serves THE BANK, and waits for it (v1.29.0)

Two things were quietly sending students the built-in practice questions
instead of the teacher's, and both looked exactly like the feature working.

- **`jqOpenGate` drew SYNCHRONOUSLY.** The first chamber is cleared long before
  four Firebase CDN modules have imported, the sign-in has resolved, the admin
  pointer has been read and the whole bank has been fetched — so `jqBank()` was
  empty and every question came out of `JQ_BUILTIN`. On a school connection
  that is several gates in a row. **`BANK.ready` is the promise the gate now
  waits on** (`jqWaitForBank`), behind a *fetching your teacher's questions…*
  card, bounded by `JQ_BANK_WAIT` so a gate can never fail to open. Every
  terminal state in the module settles that promise — a branch that announces
  and does not `done()` leaves every gate for the rest of the run waiting the
  full timeout.
- **The allowlist refused an `explanation` block**, and the portal's own AI
  writes one onto very nearly every question it builds. `buildOpenBody` hides
  an explanation and a widget until the student has answered, and
  `renderImportedBlockStudent` returns `''` for an answer key and a page break
  — so `IGNORED_BLOCKS` is the portal's own "not shown inside the question"
  set, and a question carrying one is an ordinary short MCQ.

Also widened, all of it still short: **one picture is carried** (an image block
or an `<img>` pasted into the wording — several is a figure study and is
refused), the stem cap is 320 characters and an option 90.

**A refusal now returns a REASON** (`{ no: 'clozebank' }`), the load tallies
them, and the card's fallback chip says which fallback it is — *not signed in*
and *no short questions in the bank* are very different things to tell a
teacher. Signed out, the card **offers to sign in** rather than quietly asking
its own questions; refusing is remembered for the run, not asked at every one
of a hundred gates.

## 🏆 The Journey leaderboard (v1.29.0)

`jb*` in `app.js` (search `THE JOURNEY LEADERBOARD`), the `.jb-*` CSS and
`#page-journeyboard` in `index.html`, the 🏆 sidebar item, and `BANK.publishBoard`
in `journey/index.html`. One row per student at **`enJourneyBoard`**, written by the
gate and read by the page. **Top 3 each month win a $10 voucher.**

- **IT RANKS ON THE QUESTIONS, NEVER ON HOW FAR THE RUN GOT.** A chapter number
  is climbed by replaying the easy chapters, and there is money on this board.
  `bestChapter` is shown because it is what a player cares about; it decides
  nothing, and the harness pins that.
- **The formula is the family's own — correct × accuracy SQUARED.** Squaring is
  what stops the board being won on volume: 900 questions at 35% must not beat
  400 at 88%. `jbScore` is the ONE place a row becomes a number, so the
  ranking, the row and the prize strip cannot disagree about who is winning.
  It clamps `correct` DOWN to `answered` — clamping the other way would hand a
  row claiming five right out of nothing answered a perfect score, and every
  student can write their own row.
- **ONLY QUESTIONS OUT OF THE BANK ARE PUBLISHED** (`jqPublishRound`). The
  built-in set is two dozen questions a student meets over and over; counting
  them would turn a board meant to measure work into one that measures how long
  a tab was left open. A round publishes ONCE, and a question nobody reached is
  not published as wrong.
- **RANKING AND PAYING ARE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS.** A tiny perfect run really can
  lead the board — that is the formula — and it is still not payable:
  `JB_MIN_QUESTIONS` is the floor, because a voucher decided on nine questions
  is a voucher decided on luck. An ineligible row is still SHOWN; it is a real
  student.
- **The voucher badge is on the MONTH board only.** On the all-time board it
  would put "🎟 $10 voucher" against three students who have not won anything
  this month — the wrong three people, on a page that reads perfectly. That bug
  shipped in the first draft and the harness caught it.
- **The month key is SINGAPORE time**, and the game carries its own copy
  (`monthKey`) because it is a separate page and cannot import this one. The
  harness checks the two against each other: drift and a run answered late on
  the 31st is filed in a month the board is not showing.
- A **retired account is off every board** (`_getRetiredUids`), a display name
  is **escaped** (a student supplies it), and every tie breaks on something
  printed on the row — accuracy, then questions, then chapter.
- The board is written by the student's own device, exactly as `enProgress` is.
  The prize is awarded by a teacher reading the board, never paid out by the
  rules.
- Run **`node tools/journey-board-tests.mjs`** after touching any of it.
